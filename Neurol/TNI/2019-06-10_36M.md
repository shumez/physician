## Terminology

## Original

> A 36-year-old immunocompetent male gardener with chronic skin lesions ([figure 1](#figure_1)) presented with a 6-month history of progressive spastic [tetraplegia]. Cervical imaging showed soft tissue lesions at the C2-to-T4 level with extension to the epidural/subdural compartments along with longitudinal intramedullary hyperintensities ([figure 2](#figure_2)). Skin biopsy revealed *[Nocardia brasiliensis]*.

###### Figure 1

> [![Figure.1][fig01]][fig01]

> Nocardiosis skin lesions  
> Skin lesions throughout the left upper limb and posterior cervical region.

###### Figure 2

> [![Figure.2][fig02]][fig02]

> RMI shows cutaneous-spinal fistula secondary to nocardiosis skin lesions  
> Sagittal T2-weighted RMI image (A) and sagittal (B) and axial (C) T1-weighted images after contrast show multiple epidural collections surrounding the cervical spine (prevertebral: arrowheads; perimedullary: arrows), causing extensive compressive medullary edema (point). Also note a fistula connecting the skin to the spinal canal (star). Peripheral lymphadenopathy is seen (cross).

### 

> Nocardia brasiliensis is an aerobic, [filamentous] gram-positive pathogen that typically inhabits the soil—hence its association with gardening.^[1]^ It generally causes skin infection, mostly in immunocompromised patients. Rarely does nocardiosis affect the CNS; its early recognition, however, is of paramount importance because it guides management and influences prognosis.^[2]^
