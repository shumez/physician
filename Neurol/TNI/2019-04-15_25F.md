> A 25-year-old woman presented for routine prenatal ultrasound, which was concerning for severe hydrocephalus. Fetal MRI at 22 weeks showed a brainstem “[kink](. "ねじれ, 曲がり")” that suggested [arrest](. "停止") or impairment in brain maturation around 7 weeks gestation, a sign of severe neurodysgenesis ([figure 1][fig_01]). Differential diagnoses included α-dystroglycanopathies, X-linked hydrocephalus, and tubulinopathies.^[1][2005_RobertsonRL_LevineD_SmithStroustrup]^ Postnatal imaging ([figure 2][fig_02]) and clinical findings of hypotonia, macrocephaly, and optic nerve hypoplasia were consistent with **Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS)**, confirmed on sequencing of the ISPD gene. WWS is a severe dystroglycanopathy of autosomal recessive inheritance characterized by muscle, eye, and brain abnormalities.^[2][2017_NIH]^ Death typically occurs within 1 year.

> Prenatal imaging
> Fetal half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin echo MRI demonstrates a small “kinked” brainstem (arrow) associated with severe supratentorial ventriculomegaly.

> Postnatal imaging
> T2-weighted MRI in (A) sagittal and (B) coronal cuts demonstrates multiple striking anomalies including cobblestoning lissencephaly, pontine and cerebellar hypoplasia, and a kink at the cervicomedullary junction consistent with Walker-Warburg syndrome.
