## Original

A 48-year-old woman with sensorineural hearing loss and diabetes presented with seizures and headache. She was thin and short-statured. Examination revealed encephalopathy, left homonymous hemianopia, and hemineglect. MRI showed slowed diffusion in right hemisphere, which did not follow a clear vascular distribution and without apparent diffusion coefficient correlate, inconsistent with infarction ([figure 1][figure_1]).^[1]^ Magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed inversion of lipid lactate peak ([figure 2][figure_2]). She had elevated pyruvate but normal lactate. EMG demonstrated myopathy without denervation. Genetic testing showed m.3243A>G pathogenic variant of the MT-TL1 gene. This mutation is found in more than 80% of patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes and always coexists with wild-type DNA.^[2]^

###### Figure 1

[![Figure.1][fig01]][fig01]

Brain MRI demonstrates a cortically based region of slow diffusion (A) in the right parietal and right temporal lobes with a small area of darkness on apparent diffusion coefficient (B, arrow), which did not correlate fully with the extent of diffusion restriction  
There was corresponding T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity along with mild effacement of the associated sulci (C). In addition, there was abnormal T2 FLAIR signal in the right medial thalamus (C, arrow).

###### Figure 2

[![Figure.2][fig02]][fig02]

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (A) within the region of slow diffusion (B) demonstrates an inverted doublet at 1.3 ppm (arrow) consistent with a lactate peak and anaerobic metabolism
