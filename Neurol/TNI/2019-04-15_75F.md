> A 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and atrial fibrillation on warfarin presented with sudden-onset confusion. A brain CT was read as normal. The international normalized ratio (INR) was 3.4. She was discharged home after resolution of her symptoms. Two weeks later, she presented with sudden-onset anomia and a right facial [droop]. The INR was 3.2. A new brain CT revealed multiple calcific emboli ([figure, B][fig]). A CT angiogram showed a large atheromatous plaque within the aortic arch extending into the origin of the brachiocephalic artery ([figure, C][fig]). Retrospectively, the initial CT already showed a calcified embolus ([figure, A][fig]). Calcified cerebral emboli are frequently overlooked.^[1][2014_OsbornAG_ShahLM_WalkerBS]^ Underlying sources may carry a high risk of recurrent embolism. Their early identification allows appropriate workup and treatment.

> (A) Initial CT scan. Arrow points to a calcific embolus. (B) A repeat CT scan shows multiple calcific emboli (arrows). (C) CT angiogram of the neck. Arrows point to a large atheromatous plaque within the aortic arch extending into the origin of the brachiocephalic artery causing a 40% stenosis.
