> A 39-year-old man presented with sudden neck pain and headache. CT showed subarachnoid hemorrhage around medulla oblongata. Diagnostic angiography demonstrated a rare **spinal dural arteriovenous fistula** at the level of C5. The fistula recruits additional spinal pial arteries from the anterior spinal artery as feeding artery, most likely due to the venous [sump]( "汚水だめ, 油だめ") effect induced by the dural shunt.^[1][2010GentiliF_WillinskyR_KimDJ]^ A spinal **pial aneurysm**, potential cause of hemorrhage, was presumed to be related to the hemodynamic stress produced by the high flow through the shunt ([figure 1](#fig1)).^[2][2011GiannottaSL_JonesJ_LucasJW]^ Endovascular embolization of the aneurysm and surgical interruption of the fistula was performed successfully ([figure 2](#fig2)).
