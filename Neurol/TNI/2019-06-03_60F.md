## Original

> An obtunded previously healthy 60-year-old woman was intubated with a 2-week history of headaches and 1-month history of memory loss. MRI was performed ([figure 1](#figure_1)). Digital subtraction angiography of the head, varicella-zoster virus PCR, immunoglobulin G in the CSF, hepatitis B/C, CSF cryptococcal antigen, HIV, Lyme serology, and syphilis screen were negative. The initial differential diagnosis included CNS vasculitis and intracerebral lymphoma. She was diagnosed with [inflammatory cerebral amyloid angiopathy] based on clinicoradiologic criteria (which has a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 97%),^[1]^ with infarction suggesting amyloid-β-related angiitis subtype. Within a few days of steroids, she was fully alert, and repeat MRI 5 months later showed improvement of leukoencephalopathy ([figure 2](#figure_2)). Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores were 23/30 2 weeks after initiation of therapy and 22/30 5 months later.

> Initial MRI  
> (A) T2-weighted confluent leukoencephalopathy extending to the subcortical white matter with mass effect.  
> (B) Diffusion-weighted imaging 10 days later with associated changes on the apparent diffusion coefficient sequence (not pictured) was consistent with infarction.  
> (C) Gradient echo sequence revealed microhemorrhages.

###### Figure 2

> [![Figure.2][fig02]][fig02]

> Radiologic improvement after steroids
> Comparison between initial imaging (A, D), around 3 weeks after initiation of steroid therapy (B, E), and after 5 months of corticosteroid therapy (C, F) showed improvement of leukoencephalopathy.
