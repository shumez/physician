## Original

> A 62-year-old previously cognitively intact man presented to the emergency department with acute impairment of anterograde memory (ability to form new memories).^[1]^ Head CT did not show acute changes; however, amnesia persisted. MRI disclosed an acute infarct in the left posterior hippocampus and a nonacute lacunar stroke in the right anterior thalamus ([figure](#figure)). Memory testing showed severe deficits in verbal and visual memory, persisting after 2 months. Bilateral lesions located anywhere in the [Papez circuit] (hippocampal formations, mammillary bodies, anterior thalamic nuclei, cingulate and parahippocampal cortices, and their connections via fornix and mammillothalamic tracts) may be implicated in marked, persistent anterograde memory deficits.^[1],[2]^ The hippocampus receives its blood supply from collateral branches of the posterior cerebral artery and the anterior choroidal artery.^[3]^ The anterior thalamus is supplied by the [tuberothalamic artery].^[4]^

> Acute infarct involving the left hippocampus and nonacute lacunar infarct in the right anterior thalamic nucleus  
> CT performed in the emergency department with a nonacute right thalamic lacune (A, arrow). Axial diffusion-weighted imaging images show hyperintensity in the left posterior hippocampus (B and C, arrows), signaling diffusion restriction. Coronal T2-weighted (D, arrow) and axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) (E, arrow) images depict hyperintensity in the left posterior hippocampus. Axial FLAIR (F, arrow) image confirms a large lacunar infarct in the right anterior thalamic nucleus. L = left; R = right.
