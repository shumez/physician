## Original

> A 39-year-old woman presented with fever, malaise, and headache after visiting Tanzania. Peripheral smear showed Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium ovale with parasitemia >14%. Within hours, she became unresponsive. MRI demonstrated punctate foci of microhemorrhage throughout the deep white matter, and hippocampal restricted diffusion ([figure](#figure)). Five days of video-EEG were negative for seizure. She was discharged after 3 weeks of [quinidine], [doxycycline], and [primaquine]. Repeat MRI showed bilateral hippocampal sclerosis; repeat EEG was normal. Follow-up examination was only notable for short-term memory impairment.

> MRI scans in cerebral malaria  
> Brain MRI with (A) positive diffusion-weighted imaging and (B) apparent diffusion coefficient dropout (arrows) consistent with acute ischemia. (C) Susceptibility-weighted imaging shows small areas of microhemorrhage (arrows) in the deep white matter. (D) Follow-up MRI 2 months later demonstrates bilateral hippocampal sclerosis.

###

> Both microhemorrhages and ischemia are seen in cerebral malaria.^[1]^ Diffuse edema and T2 white matter hyperintensities are also common,^[2]^ although not appreciated here. Given prolonged EEG monitoring without seizure, the bilateral hippocampal sclerosis is likely secondary to microvascular ischemia.
