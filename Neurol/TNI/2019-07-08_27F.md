## Original

> A 27-year-old woman presented to the neurosurgery department with a history of an incidental finding of an intracranial lesion. Neurologic examination was unremarkable. Cranial MRI revealed an interhemispheric lipoma over the corpus callosum ([figure][fig]). A diagnosis of pericallosal [curvilinear lipoma] was made. Intracranial lipoma is a rare congenital malformation.^[1]^ Pericallosal region is the most common location of intracranial lipomas. Pericallosal lipoma can be divided into 2 morphologic subtypes: tubulonodular and [curvilinear].^[2]^ The latter is mostly asymptomatic, occasionally presenting with seizures and headache, and has a low incidence of other accompanying anomalies. In this patient, surgical resection was not necessary, and regular follow-up was recommended.
