## Original

> A 45-year-old man presented with increasing visual impairment. MRI showed a nonspecific lesion at the cavernous sinus; an additional 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT showed an extraordinarily high 68Ga-DOTATATE uptake of the lesion ([figure](#figure)). Stereotactic brain biopsy was performed and revealed an initial manifestation of neurosarcoidosis. 68Ga-DOTATATE targets the somatostatin receptor (SSR), which is expressed by tumor cells in malignancies such as neuroendocrine tumors and meningioma, but also by activated macrophages,^[1]^ as present in neurosarcoidosis. Targeted radionuclide therapies using SSR ligands labeled with beta-emitting isotopes might offer additional therapeutic options in patients with treatment-refractory neurosarcodosis,^[2]^ as also effectively applied in SSR-positive malignancies.

> ^68^Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, MRI, and histology  
> MRI: Contrast-enhancing lesion in the cavernous sinus with perifocal edema and contact to the chiasm and the blood vessels. ^68^Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT: high ^68^Ga-DOTATATE uptake. Hematoxylin & eosin staining: noncaseating epithelioid granulomas. CD68 staining: tightly packed epitheloid macrophages. Gomori staining: incipient perigranulomatous fibrosis surrounded by leukocyte common antigen (LCA)–positive lymphocytes (magnification ×20, bars 100 μm).
