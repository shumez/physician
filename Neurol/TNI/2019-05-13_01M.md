## Original

> A 12-month-old boy, born to [consanguineous] parents, presented with developmental delay and macrocephaly. MRI revealed diffuse cerebral white matter T2 hyperintensity and temporal subcortical cysts ([figure](#figure)), leading to a diagnosis of **megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC)**. Diffuse white matter changes and temporal subcortical cysts are hallmarks of this rare disorder^[1],[2]^; these features, in addition to the lack of basal ganglia involvement, distinguish MLC from other leukodystrophies.^[1]^ MLC is caused by *MLC1* or *GLIALCAM* mutations leading to a defect of brain ion and water homeostasis.^[2]^ Clinical features include macrocephaly, mild developmental delay, and easily controlled seizures.^[1]^

> Brain MRI  
> (A) Parasagittal T1-weighted image shows diffuse cerebral white matter hypointensity with temporal subcortical cyst.  
> (B) Axial T2-weighted image shows increased characteristic diffuse supratentorial white matter signal intensity.  
> (C) Coronal fluid-attenuation inverse recovery image shows bilateral symmetrical anterior temporal lobe subcortical cysts.
