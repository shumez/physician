## Original

> An 8-month-old boy presented with developmental delay, diffuse hypotonia, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, undescended testes, neonatal thrombocytopenia, and unusual facies. Chromosome microarray showed an 11q23-11q24 deletion, consistent with Jacobsen syndrome (JS).

> Initial head MRI at 18 months showed severe diffuse hypomyelination of cerebral white matter believed to be consistent with leukodystrophy ([figure 1](#fig1)). Repeat MRI at 3 years of age showed less extensive hypomyelination ([figure 2](#fig2)). The child, while still delayed, had made some developmental progression.

###### Figure 1

> Fig.1 MRI brain at 18 months of age  
> Axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI shows white matter hypomyelination of cerebral as well as deep white matter consistent with leukodystrophy.

###### Figure 2

> Fig.2 MRI brain at 3 years of age  
> Axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI shows improved degree of white matter myelination.

> While delayed myelination has been reported, there are few reports of neuroimages. Awareness of the MRI presentation of JS is crucial to prevent unnecessary evaluation in this condition. [1][2015GrossfeldP_AkshoomoffN_FavierR],[2][2016BazanC_CarterJE_YuF]
