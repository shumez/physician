> A diabetic 54-year-old woman with HIV infection presented headache, nasal discharge, and ophthalmoplegia for 1 month. CSF showed lymphocytic pleocytosis. CT disclosed invasive sinusopathy. Histopathologic analysis confirmed mucormycosis ([figure 1](#fig1)). Angiography with high-resolution vessel wall imaging (**HR-VWI**) was performed ([figure 2](#fig2)). She died despite surgical debridements and treatment with liposomal amphotericin B.

###### Figure 1

> Axial CT scan discloses soft tissue in ethmoidal cells and sphenoid sinus with erosion of lamina papyraceae  
> (A, B) There is extension of inflammatory process to orbits.  
> (C, D) Necrotic tissue invaded by large and nonseptate hyphae, consistent with mucormycosis (×40).

###### Figure 2

> 3D time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography and volume rendering reconstruction depict left carotid artery (LCA) stenosis and infectious pseudoaneurysms  
> (A, B) High-resolution vessel wall imaging postcontrast demonstrates a concentric thickening of LCA.  
> There is inflammatory process in inner layer and probable area of necrosis in outer layer. There is also septic thrombosis in left cavernous sinus (C, D).

> HR-VWI is useful in vasculitis evaluation due to its ability to demonstrate enhancement in the area of inflammation.^[1][2016Mossa-BoshaM_BrinjikjiW_LehmanVT],[2][2014MederJF_GentricJC_EdjlaliM]^ In this case, smooth and concentric vessel wall enhancement related to inflammation was observed. Further studies are required to determine the accuracy of this method for mucormycosis.
