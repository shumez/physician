## Original

    * headache
    * tenderness Lt temples

    * GCA (giant cell arteritis)
* Rx
    * corticosteroid


> A 51-year-old woman presented with a severe new-onset headache and tenderness over her left [temples], jaw [claudication], and fever. Laboratory tests revealed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (105 mm/h). These findings fulfilled the giant cell arteritis (GCA) classification criteria.^[1][1990_HunderGG]^ The headache rapidly subsided following corticosteroid therapy.

* Ex
    * MR
        * diffuse enhancement of Lt pterygoid & temporalis muscle
    * 18F-FDG PET <!--fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose-->
        * uptake
* Dx
    * pterygoid myositis
        

> Imaging studies were performed to clarify the etiology since Gram-positive cocci were identified and multiple nodules were revealed by chest X-ray. The brain MRI showed a diffuse enhancement of the left lateral pterygoid and temporalis muscle and fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET revealed an intense uptake at the same area ([figure](#figure)). Pterygoid myositis is an underrecognized disease and must be considered as a differential diagnosis of GCA.^[2][2005_RahmanW]^

> Brain MRI and 18F-FDG PET  
> (A) Brain MRI. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image shows high signal intensities in the left lateral pterygoid muscle (arrow) and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted image reveals diffuse enhancement of the muscle (arrow).  
> (B) 18F-FDG PET shows an intense uptake by the left pterygoid muscle (arrow).
