## Original

> A 36-year-old man developed progressive limb pain, excessive sweating, and muscle cramps. He described transient [strain]ed voice only after drinking cold water ([video 1][vid01]). Examination revealed generalized [myokymia] and [pseudomyotonia]. EMG revealed multiple spontaneous, continuous high frequency doublet and triplet motor unit discharges. Nerve conduction studies and chest CT scan were normal. CASPR2 and LGI1 antibodies were negative. Autoimmune, paraneoplastic, and other etiologies were excluded clinically as well as through additional serologic (or blood) testing and imaging. Symptoms resolved completely after IV immunoglobulin and carbamazepine for treatment of pain.

###

> Painful cramps, myokymia, hyperhidrosis, and pseudomyotonia are cardinal features of **[Isaacs syndrome]**. Isaacs syndrome is a peripheral nerve hyperexcitability disorder often associated with antibodies targeting components of voltage-gated potassium channels; however, <50% of patients are antibody-positive.^[1]^ Bulbar involvement is an uncommon feature, and our patient exhibits **cold-induced pseudomyotonia**, which has not been previously described in the literature.^[2]^
