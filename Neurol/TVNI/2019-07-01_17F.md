> A 17-year-old girl presented with slowly progressive binocular horizontal diplopia, worse for distance viewing. She had distance [esotropia] ([video][vid]), gaze-evoked nystagmus, broken smooth pursuit, reduced horizontal optokinetic nystagmus, and impaired vestibulo-ocular reflex suppression (VORS; [video][vid]), in keeping with cerebellar dysfunction. The patient had full abduction during monocular viewing and head rotations, and normal saccadic velocities, excluding a bilateral sixth nerve palsy. An MRI scan confirmed a type 1 Chiari malformation ([figure][fig]). A careful oculomotor assessment in patients with esotropia, including bedside VORS,^[1]^ may identify cerebellar signs that would suggest the tropia is cerebellar in origin.^[2]^ Cerebellar esotropia may arise from dorsal vermis impairment,^[2]^ or possibly from [floccular][flocculus] and [parafloccular][paraflocculus] dysfunction, explaining the associated abnormalities in smooth pursuit, optokinetic nystagmus, and VORS that share common neural pathways.
