## Original

> A 50-year-old woman presented with painless dysphagia and dysarthria. There was no radiation exposure. Examination revealed involuntary tongue movements and reduced bulk with deviation to the right on protrusion. The remaining neurologic examination was normal. MRI brain/skull base with contrast was normal.

> Ultrasound examination before EMG demonstrated abnormal tongue movement along with the sonographic anatomy of the submental muscles and tongue ([video 1][vid]).^[1]^ Ultrasound allows for dynamic assessment of the tongue, which is otherwise impossible with other imaging techniques.^[2]^ Right genioglossus EMG confirmed myokymia and sparse fasciculations with background chronic neurogenic motor unit rearrangement and reduced recruitment.

> ![Video][vid]

> Video 1.  
> Ultrasound examination of the genioglossus showed abnormal echotexture of the right tongue associated with [myokymia] and fasciculations of the tongue, characterized by repeated and sustained twisting motions of small portions of the tongue, more prominent on the right side of the tongue (left side of the screen).

> The diagnosis was chronic idiopathic hypoglossal neuropathy with clinical remission but subsequent deterioration due to the development of nerve hyperexcitability.
