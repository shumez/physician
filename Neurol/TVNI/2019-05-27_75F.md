## Original

> A 75-year-old woman with a history of multiple resolved hemiparetic strokes presented with unilateral ischemic stroke causing sudden **loss of volitional control** of the musculature crucial for speaking and swallowing. Automatic movements, such as laughter and yawning, were preserved ([video 1] and [figure]). She was diagnosed with **[Foix-Chavany-Marie syndrome] (FCMS)**. Lesions of the [operculum] or its projections to brainstem nuclei can cause FCMS.^[1]^ Because these muscles receive bilateral innervation, a new unilateral lesion can produce sudden bilateral weakness if an old contralateral lesion was compensated by the intact hemisphere. **Spontaneous movements, controlled by extrapyramidal pathways, are preserved**.^[2]^

> This video shows the clinical examination of the patient demonstrating Foix-Chavany-Marie syndrome.

> Neuroimaging of Foix-Marie-Chavany syndrome  
> (A) T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI demonstrates substantial preexisting ischemic burden, notably in the left pons.  
> (B) Our patient compensated for these previous insults, until a small unilateral stroke of the right corona radiata caused bilateral weakness of the muscles crucial for speaking and swallowing.
