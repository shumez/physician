Weakness began asymmetrically in the legs. She had trouble standing on her toes and developed progressive bilateral foot drop, worse on the right. Over the years, she developed difficulty arising from low seats and climbing stairs. She began falling with her knees buckling bilaterally. She was a hairstylist, but stopped working about 2 years prior after the onset of weakness in her hands, including difficulty opening jars or using scissors. These symptoms progressed insidiously over the years without fluctuation. The patient\u2019s medical history was unremarkable and she was not taking medications. Neurologic review of systems was negative for visual changes, dysphagia, dysarthria, pain, stiffness, sensory changes, or bowel/bladder dysfunction. She also denied dyspnea, myalgias, exercise intolerance, or myoglobinuria. All childhood developmental milestones were appropriate. Her parents were not consanguineous and there was no reported family history of weakness or symptoms of nerve or muscle disease. On examination, the patient had short stature and a thin body habitus. She appeared comfortable with normal respiratory rate. Paradoxical breathing and accessory respiratory muscle use was not seen. Mental status was normal. Cranial nerve examination was normal. Speech was clear and palate elevated symmetrically. On motor examination, there was reduced muscle bulk in the distal legs including calves and tibialis anterior. Tone was normal in the arms and legs; no fasciculations were noted. She did not have action or percussion myotonia or scapular winging. Power on testing neck flexion was grade 4/5. Strength testing in the limbs revealed the following (table): 1) disproportionate weakness of the great toe was not seen. The patient could not perform one-legged calf raises with either leg; 2) reflexes were 3+ throughout except absent right patella and Achilles tendon reflexes. Sensation was normal to all modalities. Coordination was normal. Gait examination showed a steppage gait on the left. Questions for consideration: \u00b6 What localizations are possible in this case? What testing would you recommend at this point? Section 2 \u00b6 This patient appears to have a longstanding insidiously progressive pure motor syndrome involving mainly distal muscles in the upper extremities and a combination of proximal and distal muscles in the legs. The presence of pure motor symptoms favors localization to motor neuron, motor nerve, muscle, or neuromuscular junction. The weakness does not appear to be strictly myotomal and there are no convincing upper motor neuron signs. Starting with the anterior horn, one consideration would be amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Classic ALS is unlikely as there are no convincing upper motor neuron findings. The progressive muscular atrophy variant of ALS is also unlikely due to the very long clinical course and absence of bulbar involvement, cramping, and fasciculations.1 Longstanding slowly progressive motor neuron diseases such as adult-onset spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) should be considered. Weakness with preserved/brisk reflexes is inconsistent with SMA, which usually presents with symmetric proximally predominant weakness. However, one should recall that there are distal predominant forms of SMA. Motor nerve diseases such as multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) often present with distal predominant weakness and could progress slowly over a period of years. Leg-onset MMN is rare as the legs are typically affected much less than the hands.3 Second, MMN typically produces weakness in the distribution of named nerves, which is not the pattern here. A motor predominant form of chronic inflammatory demyelination neuropathy is possible but patients usually have some sensory involvement and deep tendon reflexes are often absent. Neuromuscular junction disorders such as myasthenia gravis typically involve facial and bulbar muscles, proximal more than distal limb weakness, lack muscle atrophy, and show some degree of fluctuation. There are myopathies that could present distally, including myotonic dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), and inherited distal myopathies. The combination of distal arm weakness with proximal leg weakness raises the question of sporadic inclusion body myopathy (sIBM), but this is very uncommon in patients under age 50 and finger flexors are usually weak. Unenhanced MRI of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral spine were normal. Routine chemistry including creatine kinase (CK) was normal. Additional bloodwork including GM1 antibodies, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, antinuclear antibodies, and thyroid-stimulating hormone was normal. Electrophysiologic studies revealed normal routine nerve conduction studies of the right arm and leg. EMG showed 1+ fibrillation potentials and low-amplitude, short-duration, polyphasic motor unit potentials with early recruitment in the right arm and leg. There were no myotonic discharges. Questions for consideration: \u00b6 What is the importance of the EMG results in terms of localization? What additional testing would you order? Section 3 \u00b6 The EMG results are consistent with a myopathy and effectively exclude a neurogenic process. While fibrillations are seen in neurogenic processes, it is important to note that denervation occurs in myopathies because of segmental necrosis and muscle fiber splitting, leading to separation of the distal portion of the muscle fiber from the more proximal portion connected to the axon terminal. The patient\u2019s diagnosis is most consistent with a myopathy beginning with distal weakness in the anterior leg compartment resulting in early foot drop then progressing gradually to involve the proximal lower extremities and distal upper extremities. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 should always be considered as it is the most common distal predominant inherited myopathy in adults, but is unlikely in our patient for several reasons. First, patients with this disorder typically report stiffness secondary to myotonia with a characteristic facial appearance. The clinical examination and EMG would be expected to show myotonia, which was not seen. sIBM should be considered in a myopathy affecting long finger flexors and knee extension, but typically effects older patients. FSHD could start distally in the legs and be asymmetric, but scapular and proximal arm muscles are usually involved and the face is involved in approximately 90% of cases. The patient agreed to proceed with muscle biopsy of the left vastus lateralis and genetic testing (figure 1). ECG and echocardiogram were obtained and were normal. Genetic testing was conducted via a next-generation sequencing 18-gene distal myopathy panel. This was ultimately negative. Questions for consideration: \u00b6 Which distal myopathies would be likeliest in the context of the clinical presentation and biopsy findings? What is the importance of the biopsy findings including the rimmed vacuoles? Discussion \u00b6 Distal myopathies are mainly inherited myopathies causing weakness and atrophy of the distal arms and legs.4,5 Family history may be absent in cases with de novo sporadic mutations.5 Some genes are co-allelic with those causing limb-girdle muscular dystrophies.5 The distal myopathies also include many of the myofibrillar myopathies, a group of myopathies specifically affecting proteins of the myofibril (including sarcomere and Z disc proteins). Myofibrillar myopathies often have systemic features including cardiac and respiratory involvement. Most distal myopathies begin in the legs and involve either predominantly the anterior or posterior compartment, with considerable overlap. Some have a specific geographic predominance due to a population founder mutation. CK is often unhelpful in the diagnosis as it is often normal or only slightly elevated, with the exception of Miyoshi (dysferlinopathy), which often has a very elevated CK. MRI can be useful in narrowing down the differential diagnosis based on muscles affected.4,6 If a specific genetic cause is suspected, gene testing should be done before muscle biopsy. When choosing genes to test, careful consideration should be given to family history, ethnicity, age at onset, and clinical site of onset. Larger panels are also available to encompass broader testing (e.g., distal myopathy panel). If the genetic differential diagnosis is very broad, muscle biopsy may be required first. This patient has a young age at symptom onset, which began distally with weakness worse in the anterior > posterior leg compartment. Inherited distal myopathies more likely to produce this pattern would include hereditary inclusion body myopathy (hIBM), Laing myopathy (MYH7 mutation), and some myofibrillar myopathies. Laing myopathy (MYH7 mutation) often presents with disproportionate weakness of extensor hallucis longus and ankle dorsiflexors. This often produces a characteristic \u201changing big toe.\u201d In this case, MYH7 testing was normal, excluding Laing myopathy. Rimmed vacuoles can be seen in sIBM, but are nonspecific with a broad differential diagnosis including hIBM, myofibrillar myopathies, Udd myopathy, Welander myopathy, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, and some limb-girdle muscular dystrophies.4 Cytoplasmic protein aggregates typical of myofibrillar myopathies were not observed. The combination of rimmed vacuoles, p62/TDP-43 immunopositive inclusions, and the intramyonuclear inclusions seen on electron microscopy are all consistent with sIBM, but the minimal inflammation and lack of major histocompatibility complex upregulation in this case were less than expected for sIBM. Altogether, the distal anterior predominant onset, patient age, and biopsy results were thought to be more consistent with hIBM than sIBM.8 sIBM cannot be excluded as rare cases with young onset and little inflammation on biopsy have been described. hIBM can be differentiated from sIBM as the latter (1) typically presents at an older age, (2) more commonly has dysphagia, (3) often involves the quadriceps, (4) is more frequently asymmetric, (5) is more likely to have increased CK, (6) and has more inflammatory/immune-related changes on biopsy.4,5,7 There are several types of hIBM.8 Nonaka myopathy (GNE mutation) often presents at a young age involving the distal anterior leg compartment. It is typically symmetric and rarely involves the quadriceps.5 CK is often normal. Desminopathy has a similar phenotype, but is also a type of myofibrillar myopathy with characteristic biopsy findings including cytoplasmic desmin aggregates, not found here. In our case, genetic testing was negative for 3 genes known to cause hIBM: desmin, GNE, and VCP. Novel hIBM mutations are frequently being discovered and gene therapy may be available in the future.8,\u2013,10 Clinicians should be aware of the most relevant genetic tests available to reach an accurate diagnosis (figure 2). \u00b6","title":"2019-01-28 40F"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-01-28_40F/#01","text":"40y/o F, Caucasian c/c: 15yrs, progressive lower leg & hand weakness asymmetrically NeuroEx - \u2193muscle bulk in distal L/E (calves / tibialis ant.)","title":"01"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-01-28_40F/#q","text":"What localizations are possible in this case?

The patient's complaints consisted of weakness, stiffness, and pain in her legs. Her medical history consisted of Hashimoto thyroiditis and breast cancer, with the latter having motivated surgery 4 months prior to admission. Histopathologic examination had demonstrated ductal cancer sensitive to estrogen and mapping with sentinel node biopsy ruled out metastasis. For that reason, the patient was treated with local radiation given weekly over 1 month and treatment with tamoxifen was started. Physical examination upon admission demonstrated weakness and spasticity in both legs. Reflexes were brisk; bilateral nonsustained foot clonus and Babinski sign were also present. Bilateral dorsal flexion was reduced, but vibration and sensation to touch and pinprick were normal. Sphincter tonus was reduced; systemic manifestations such as myalgias, fever, skin rashes, uveitis, sicca, and arthritic joints were absent. Questions for consideration: \u00b6 What is the proper workup? What is the differential diagnosis of this presentation? Section 2 \u00b6 The phenomenology is compatible with spastic paraparesis. The history of cancer raises the suspicion of spinal metastasis or paraneoplastic myelopathy. However, at the time point of examination and during follow-up (5 years later) no evidence of cancer recurrence was detected. The patient underwent investigations with laboratory tests, MRI of the brain and spinal cord with gadolinium contrast, neurophysiologic tests, and lumbar puncture. Neuroimaging yielded normal results but motor evoked potential demonstrated affection of the corticospinal tracts likely at the thoracic level. Additional investigations with EMG did not display neurogenic potentials, myokymic discharges, fibrillation potentials, positive sharp waves, or fasciculation potentials, making amyotrophic lateral sclerosis unlikely. However, upper motor neuron signs with a protracted course may indicate primary lateral sclerosis. Nerve conduction velocities displayed bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, which in this context is a coincidental finding. HIV is also associated with myelopathy but in this case there was no evidence of immunosuppression and testing for this virus was negative. Analysis of the CSF demonstrated monocytic pleocytosis but PCR and serologic analyses for the most common neurotropic viruses and bacteria were negative (table 1). Screening with rheumatologic, GAD, and onconeuronal autoantibodies was also negative. Cobalamin, folic acid levels, and routine laboratory tests were normal. In a patient with a recent history of breast cancer, paraneoplastic myelopathy has to be considered; however, normal imaging, normal protein levels in the CSF, and absence of onconeuronal antibodies argued against it. Common causes of spastic paraparesis (spinal cord compression, multiple sclerosis, transverse myelitis, and vascular malformation) were otherwise ruled out by the normal imaging. Normal imaging makes radiation myelopathy unlikely. As the differential diagnosis for spastic paraparesis is broad, we summarize it in table e-1 (doi.org/10.5061/dryad.f02h5k2). The patient's condition progressed, resulting in major gait disability; the patient requires the constant use of a walker for mobility and her leg spasticity increased (modified Ashworth score 3) (video 1). Spastic paraplegia rating scale at age 53 was 39 points (range 0\u201352 points), with the patient developing depression during the course of the disease. Questions for consideration: \u00b6 Is there any additional analysis to consider? Is there any treatment indicated at this point? Section 3 \u00b6 The patient turned out to be seropositive for human T-cell lymphotropic (formerly leukemia) virus (HTLV-1). This serologic finding was confirmed in a reference laboratory. Antibodies against HTLV-1 were found in the CSF as well. Taken together, the patient met the criteria for HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (HAM), previously known as tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP).1 HAM/TSP is a feared incurable complication of HTLV-1 infection. Onset is usually at adult age and more common among women. HAM/TSP is characterized by slowly progressive spastic paraparesis, bladder dysfunction, constipation, and sensory symptoms. The association with HTLV-1 was discovered independently in Martinique and in Japan.2,3 Neuroimaging usually displays nonspecific white matter abnormalities in the brain and spinal cord but can be normal early in the course of HAM/TSP. Lymphocyte infiltration starts likely at the thoracic level of the spinal cord, leading to its demyelination and atrophy.1 For women, sexually acquired HTLV-1 has been proposed as a risk factor for the development of HAM/TSP.4 Proviral load (PVL) measures viral genetic material integrated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells with levels over 1% considered as a proxy biomarker for complications associated with HTLV-1 infection.5 HAM/TSP is characterized by higher PVL values compared with asymptomatic carriers.5 Increasing PVL has also been reported in other HTLV-1 complications,6 though PVL is neither specific nor helpful to predict the kind of complications. In this current case, PVL was 13.2% at the time of diagnosis. Other than the Caribbean basin, HTLV-1 foci are found in Southern Japan, the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, South America, and among Aborigines in Australia. Based on prevalence data in known endemic regions, it is believed that 5\u201310 million individuals are infected with HTLV-1 worldwide. Clinical studies with antiviral drugs have been disappointing in HAM/TSP; hence treatment is largely symptomatic.1,6 IV steroids can be used when progression rate is rapid; however, in this case, IV steroids were not beneficial. Methotrexate was also tried, but discontinued due to limited compliance. Botulinum toxin injections were given to both legs but the patient declined continuation. Symptomatic treatment with tolterodine and citalopram was initiated during the course of disease; neither gabapentin nor baclofen provided relief for spasticity and were discontinued; tizanidine was added later on. A recent trial demonstrated that mogamulizumab reduced spasticity, PVL, and markers of inflammation in the CSF in a small cohort of Japanese patients with HAM/TSP.8 The long-term benefit and potential complications of this treatment are unknown. Of note, HTLV-1 does not infect neurons, microglia, or astrocytes,5 and a solid body of evidence indicates an exaggerated immunologic reaction that involves mainly astrocytes and lymphocyte infiltration into the spinal cord. The process leading to a chronic myelitis is mediated by CXCL10. A new cancer disease, adult T-cell leukemia, was characterized in Japan in the 1970s. Later, Robert Gallo's10 group isolated HTLV-1 in tissue samples from these patients, thereby proving for the first time that a virus was associated with human cancer diseases. Some HTLV-1-positive patients are prone to severe immunosuppression and face recurrent or disseminated infection with Strongyloides stercolaris, but this current case was seronegative for this parasite. Acute myelitis caused by HTLV-1 is rare; other neurologic manifestations than spastic paraparesis are also rare and include cerebellar ataxia and cranial nerve affection. Other conditions associated with HTLV-1 include uveitis, polymyositis, and infective dermatitis. HAM/TSP and other complications secondary to HTLV-1 infection constitute neglected conditions. The pressing need for better disease control, biomarkers, vaccines, and treatments has been highlighted recently by leading experts in the field. There are several teaching points in this case. First, it is an unusual etiology that requires a high index of suspicion. Travel to and migration from endemic regions elevates the probability of meeting HTLV-1-positive patients in countries with low prevalence. Thus, HTLV-1 should be considered in the context of myelopathies of unknown cause. Second, even though treatment is symptomatic and the prognosis dire, correct diagnosis is important in order to prevent further transmission. \u00b6","title":"2019-02-04 48F"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-02-04_48F/#01","text":"48y/o, F c/c: - insidious gait difficulty - urgency - constipation (\u2013 6mo) c/o: - weakness - stiffness - pain in legs PMHx: - Hashimoto thyroiditis - breast cancer - ductal cancer - sensitive to E - Rx: - RT - tamoxifen PEx: - M - weakness, spaticity 4/E - Bilt nonsustained foot clonus, Babinski sign - Bilt dorsal flex\u2193 - S - nl","title":"01"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-02-04_48F/#q","text":"proper workup?

The history of cancer raises the suspicion of spinal metastasis or paraneoplastic myelopathy. However, at the time point of examination and during follow-up (5 years later) no evidence of cancer recurrence was detected. The patient underwent investigations with laboratory tests, MRI of the brain and spinal cord with gadolinium contrast, neurophysiologic tests, and lumbar puncture. Neuroimaging yielded normal results but motor evoked potential demonstrated affection of the corticospinal tracts likely at the thoracic level. Additional investigations with EMG did not display neurogenic potentials, myokymic discharges, fibrillation potentials, positive sharp waves, or fasciculation potentials, making amyotrophic lateral sclerosis unlikely. However, upper motor neuron signs with a protracted course may indicate primary lateral sclerosis. Nerve conduction velocities displayed bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, which in this context is a coincidental finding. HIV is also associated with myelopathy but in this case there was no evidence of immunosuppression and testing for this virus was negative. Analysis of the CSF demonstrated monocytic pleocytosis but PCR and serologic analyses for the most common neurotropic viruses and bacteria were negative (table 1). Screening with rheumatologic, GAD, and onconeuronal autoantibodies was also negative. Cobalamin, folic acid levels, and routine laboratory tests were normal. In a patient with a recent history of breast cancer, paraneoplastic myelopathy has to be considered; however, normal imaging, normal protein levels in the CSF, and absence of onconeuronal antibodies argued against it. Common causes of spastic paraparesis (spinal cord compression, multiple sclerosis, transverse myelitis, and vascular malformation) were otherwise ruled out by the normal imaging. Normal imaging makes radiation myelopathy unlikely. As the differential diagnosis for spastic paraparesis is broad, we summarize it in table e-1 (doi.org/10.5061/dryad.f02h5k2). The patient's condition progressed, resulting in major gait disability; the patient requires the constant use of a walker for mobility and her leg spasticity increased (modified Ashworth score 3) (video 1). Spastic paraplegia rating scale at age 53 was 39 points (range 0\u201352 points), with the patient developing depression during the course of the disease.","title":"Section 2"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-02-04_48F/#questions_for_consideration_1","text":"Is there any additional analysis to consider?

This serologic finding was confirmed in a reference laboratory. Antibodies against HTLV-1 were found in the CSF as well. Taken together, the patient met the criteria for HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (HAM), previously known as tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP).1 HAM/TSP is a feared incurable complication of HTLV-1 infection. Onset is usually at adult age and more common among women. HAM/TSP is characterized by slowly progressive spastic paraparesis, bladder dysfunction, constipation, and sensory symptoms. The association with HTLV-1 was discovered independently in Martinique and in Japan.2,3 Neuroimaging usually displays nonspecific white matter abnormalities in the brain and spinal cord but can be normal early in the course of HAM/TSP. Lymphocyte infiltration starts likely at the thoracic level of the spinal cord, leading to its demyelination and atrophy.1 For women, sexually acquired HTLV-1 has been proposed as a risk factor for the development of HAM/TSP.4 Proviral load (PVL) measures viral genetic material integrated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells with levels over 1% considered as a proxy biomarker for complications associated with HTLV-1 infection.5 HAM/TSP is characterized by higher PVL values compared with asymptomatic carriers.5 Increasing PVL has also been reported in other HTLV-1 complications,6 though PVL is neither specific nor helpful to predict the kind of complications. In this current case, PVL was 13.2% at the time of diagnosis. Other than the Caribbean basin, HTLV-1 foci are found in Southern Japan, the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, South America, and among Aborigines in Australia. Based on prevalence data in known endemic regions, it is believed that 5\u201310 million individuals are infected with HTLV-1 worldwide. Clinical studies with antiviral drugs have been disappointing in HAM/TSP; hence treatment is largely symptomatic.1,6 IV steroids can be used when progression rate is rapid; however, in this case, IV steroids were not beneficial. Methotrexate was also tried, but discontinued due to limited compliance. Botulinum toxin injections were given to both legs but the patient declined continuation. Symptomatic treatment with tolterodine and citalopram was initiated during the course of disease; neither gabapentin nor baclofen provided relief for spasticity and were discontinued; tizanidine was added later on.

One month prior, she was a restrained driver in a head-on motor vehicle collision with possible brief loss of consciousness. The patient was evaluated at an emergency department and was noted to have musculoskeletal injuries not requiring intervention. No imaging was performed. Since the accident, she described feeling a \u201cmental fog\u201d with slurred speech that has progressively worsened and persistent left shoulder pain. About 1 week prior to presentation at our facility, she developed nonvoluntary movements starting in her left shoulder, described as \u201cflopping,\u201d with gradual progression to incorporate the whole upper limb that spread to the ipsilateral leg and face. These movements became more frequent and increased in amplitude over a week. There was no change in consciousness, loss of bowel/bladder function, or tongue biting during these movements, and no postevent confusion. Due to interference with daily activities, she presented to the emergency department for further evaluation, where a CT head demonstrated a hyperdense lesion in the right basal ganglia with limited surrounding edema. The patient\u2019s vital signs were within normal limits and neurologic examination was notable for mild dysarthria with dyskinetic oromandibular facial movements, intact strength throughout (though limited by left shoulder pain), mild left dysmetria, and left dysdiadochokinesia. At rest, she had intermittent ballistic\u2013choreic movements of her left upper and lower extremities with involvement of the face and tongue, which worsened with intentional maneuvers. Questions for consideration: \u00b6 What is your initial differential diagnosis? What laboratory or imaging studies would you perform for further evaluation? Section 2 \u00b6 The initial differential of acquired causes of hemichorea\u2013hemiballism includes vascular, autoimmune/inflammatory, metabolic, infectious, toxin/drug-induced, and neoplastic or other structural etiologies.1,\u2013,3 In particular, stroke, Wilson disease, thyrotoxicosis, hyperglycemia, and systemic lupus erythematosus have been known to cause this syndrome.1 Genetic causes were less likely given age and CT abnormalities. Preliminary laboratory studies demonstrated signs of a urinary tract infection (urinalysis with positive leukocyte esterase and 87 white blood cells) without evidence of systemic infection or inflammation (white blood cells 7.1, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 26) and poorly controlled diabetes (serum glucose 425, urine trace ketones, HbA1c 14). Other evidence of infection was not seen in the CSF (negative tuberculosis and bacterial/fungal cultures) or serum (toxoplasma immunoglobulin G and M). MRI brain with contrast obtained during admission revealed rim-enhancing lesions within the right caudate head and anterior aspect of the right putamen without diffusion restriction but with intralesional hemorrhage (figure). MRI was repeated 2 months later and demonstrated new confluent areas of T1 hyperintensity involving the right lentiform nucleus sparing the right internal capsule with increasing volume loss of the right caudate head and resolution of T2 hyperintensity in this region (figure). Questions for consideration: \u00b6 What is the differential for rim-enhancing brain lesions on MRI? What is your differential diagnosis for this patient? Is there any historical information on this patient that would be useful? Section 3 \u00b6 The differential for rim/ring-enhancing lesions can be remembered with the mnemonic MAGICAL DR: metastasis, abscess, glioblastoma, infarction (subacute), contusion, aneurysm, lymphoma, demyelination, and radiation necrosis or resolving hematoma.4 It may also be worthwhile to consider nonabscess infections such as tuberculomas and neurocysticercosis. The common elements in the differential for acquired causes of hemiballism and ring-enhancing lesions narrow the list to favor infectious, neoplastic, and ischemic etiologies. In addition to the enhancing lesion, imaging was also notable for right putaminal T1 hyperintensity, which suggested a possible metabolic process vs substance deposition of lipid, protein, or hemosiderin. This complicates the differential as none of the favored etiologies should present with this hyperintensity, suggesting a possible secondary pathology or an atypical presentation. Chart review for background was notable for negative lymph nodes at breast cancer lumpectomy and laboratory studies drawn 8 days prior to presentation that demonstrated a blood glucose level of 599 whereas prior glucose levels were 120\u2013200 with a HbA1c 7.0 3 months prior to presentation compared to 14 on presentation. Questions for consideration: \u00b6 What is your final diagnosis? How would you treat this patient? Section 4 \u00b6 The patient presented with subacute onset of left hemiballism 1 month after head trauma in setting of multiple vascular risk factors, acute-on-chronic hyperglycemia, and history of cancer. Imaging was notable for persistent T1 hyperintensity of the right lentiform nucleus and rim-enhancing lesions of the right caudate head and anterior putamen progressing to caudate volume loss. She was started on quetiapine for the hemiballism and strict diabetes control was recommended. On follow-up 3 months after symptom onset, her HbA1c was 7.3 and her movements had markedly diminished. She was trialed off of quetiapine but had return of less-severe hemiballism for which she restarted quetiapine. The history, laboratory studies, MRI findings with interval change, and clinical progression indicate that hyperglycemic injury with subacute small vessel infarction is the most likely diagnosis. Discussion \u00b6 In this 65-year-old woman with multiple medical comorbidities, subacute onset of a relatively uncommon movement disorder with atypical imaging findings presented a diagnostic challenge. There is a long differential for acquired causes of hemiballism and of those without more systemic presentations, vascular, metabolic, drug, and structural lesions were thought most likely. While her initial CT was concerning for hemorrhage vs neoplasm, her subsequent MRIs broadened the differential to include infarction, infectious/inflammatory, and metabolic processes. The ring-enhancing lesion in the basal ganglia was concerning for an infectious etiology such as toxoplasma although she did not fit the classic history. She had no history of being clearly immunocompromised outside of her diabetes, and lacked systemic symptoms or supportive laboratory studies to suggest an infectious etiology. Her symptoms were limited to her left hemibody without encephalopathy, which argued against an autoimmune, inflammatory, or toxic cause, and was further supported by laboratory workup. She had a history of remote breast cancer, which is known to metastasize to the brain, and recent trauma; however, imaging was not consistent with either process. Given the persistent high T1 signal intensity in the putamen, which is characteristic of hyperglycemic injury,5,6 and the progressive encephalomalacia of the caudate suggestive of infarction in the clinical setting of acutely elevated glucose near the time of symptom onset with multiple vascular risk factors, the final diagnosis is subacute small vessel infarction with concurrent hyperglycemic injury. Vascular lesions, either ischemic or hemorrhagic, are the most common cause of nongenetic chorea in the hospital population of patients over 50, with early or delayed hemiballism in 1% of poststroke patients.7 The correlating lesions are in the basal ganglia and adjacent white matter, usually in the territory of the middle cerebral artery or posterior cerebral artery.7 Poststroke dyskinesias, of which the most commonly reported is hemichorea\u2013hemiballism,3 may present acutely or be delayed by months to years followed by a highly variable course that may be transient, recurrent, persistent, or progressive; however, they are usually self-limited and resolve within 6\u201312 months. Hyperglycemic hemiballism is the second most common cause of acute hemiballism.2 The first case of hemichorea\u2013hemiballism associated with hyperglycemia was described by Bedwell in 1960 and was initially most frequently reported in elderly, typically East Asian, women with diabetes mellitus type 2.5 As the hyperglycemia develops, hemiballistic movement emerges, although case reports have suggested both acute as well as delayed dyskinesia appearance.2 High signal intensity on T1-weighted images in the putamen is classically associated with this condition. While diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for dyskinesia due to hyperglycemia, it is also a risk factor for ischemic stroke. Diabetes is independently associated with a 60% risk for recurrent stroke in those over 65 years old and is a key risk factor for first-ever ischemic stroke.8 Therefore, while these distinct etiologies of poststroke hemiballism and hyperglycemia\u2013hemiballism are both relatively rare, they both may stem from pathologic hyperglycemia and other poorly controlled vascular risk factors. In terms of management, strict glycemic control is key for both etiologies as well as secondary stroke prevention. Symptomatically, hemichorea\u2013hemiballism tends to resolve spontaneously, with hyperglycemic hemiballism movements disappearing as soon as hours after glucose correction, although 20% of patients have persistent hemiballism for longer than 3 months, which is often milder than at presentation.2 Stroke-related hemiballism usually resolves within 6\u201312 months after onset.3 However, short-term treatment may be required for symptom control. Pharmacotherapy consists mainly of antidopaminergic therapy with typical or atypical antipsychotics that block the striatal D2 receptors believed to be responsible for dyskinetic activity.3 This patient was started on quetiapine and by 3 months had excellent glucose control (HbA1c 7.3) with improved but persistent symptoms (videos 1\u20133). \u00b6","title":"2019-02-11 65F"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-02-11_65F/#01","text":"65yo, F, Rt-handed","title":"01"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-02-11_65F/#cc","text":"1w, progressive, involuntary Lt hemibody movements","title":"c/c"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-02-11_65F/#hpi","text":"\u2013 1m vehicle collision 'mental fog' w/ slurred speech persistent Lt shoulder pain nonvoluntary movements Lt shoulder, \"flopping\" U/E, L/E more frequent & \u2191Amp + 1w CT hyperdense lesion in Rt BG","title":"HPI"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-02-11_65F/#q","text":"initial DDx ?

Vascular lesions, either ischemic or hemorrhagic, are the most common cause of nongenetic chorea in the hospital population of patients over 50, with early or delayed hemiballism in 1% of poststroke patients.7 The correlating lesions are in the basal ganglia and adjacent white matter, usually in the territory of the middle cerebral artery or posterior cerebral artery.7 Poststroke dyskinesias, of which the most commonly reported is hemichorea\u2013hemiballism,3 may present acutely or be delayed by months to years followed by a highly variable course that may be transient, recurrent, persistent, or progressive; however, they are usually self-limited and resolve within 6\u201312 months. Hyperglycemic hemiballism is the second most common cause of acute hemiballism.2 The first case of hemichorea\u2013hemiballism associated with hyperglycemia was described by Bedwell in 1960 and was initially most frequently reported in elderly, typically East Asian, women with diabetes mellitus type 2.5 As the hyperglycemia develops, hemiballistic movement emerges, although case reports have suggested both acute as well as delayed dyskinesia appearance.2 High signal intensity on T1-weighted images in the putamen is classically associated with this condition. While diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for dyskinesia due to hyperglycemia, it is also a risk factor for ischemic stroke. Diabetes is independently associated with a 60% risk for recurrent stroke in those over 65 years old and is a key risk factor for first-ever ischemic stroke.8 Therefore, while these distinct etiologies of poststroke hemiballism and hyperglycemia\u2013hemiballism are both relatively rare, they both may stem from pathologic hyperglycemia and other poorly controlled vascular risk factors. In terms of management, strict glycemic control is key for both etiologies as well as secondary stroke prevention. Symptomatically, hemichorea\u2013hemiballism tends to resolve spontaneously, with hyperglycemic hemiballism movements disappearing as soon as hours after glucose correction, although 20% of patients have persistent hemiballism for longer than 3 months, which is often milder than at presentation.2 Stroke-related hemiballism usually resolves within 6\u201312 months after onset.3 However, short-term treatment may be required for symptom control. Pharmacotherapy consists mainly of antidopaminergic therapy with typical or atypical antipsychotics that block the striatal D2 receptors believed to be responsible for dyskinetic activity.3 This patient was started on quetiapine and by 3 months had excellent glucose control (HbA1c 7.3) with improved but persistent symptoms (videos 1\u20133).","title":"Discussion"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-02-25_36F/","text":"Clinical Reasoning: A pregnant woman with chin numbness \u00b6 01 \u00b6 36yo, F, W24, G1P0 G : Gravidity (pregnant) P : Parity 02 \u00b6 03 \u00b6 04 \u00b6 discussion \u00b6 Section 1 \u00b6 A 36-year-old 24 weeks pregnant woman (G1P0) presented to the emergency department with a 5-day history of paresthesias involving the left side of her chin beginning at the midline and extending towards the corner of her mouth as well as intermittent bilateral upper extremity paresthesias. There were no accompanying weakness, bulbar symptoms, or bowel or bladder difficulties, and no recent history of trauma to the head or neck. She had a 2-day history of night sweats. Aside from these recent symptoms, she had been well. Her medical history was notable for hypothyroidism, for which she was taking levothyroxine 125 \u03bcg daily, and septic arthritis of the right hip 2 years prior. The emergency medicine physician examined her and no focal deficits were noted. She declined further investigations and went home. One week later, she returned with persistent drenching night sweats, severe fatigue, and bilateral chin numbness. In addition, her arm paresthesias had evolved to lancinating pain described as \u201celectrical\u201d and left arm weakness. She was examined by an emergency medicine physician, who noted bilateral pinprick sensation loss on her chin from the midline to the corners of her mouth. Cranial nerves were otherwise normal. Motor examination demonstrated normal bulk and tone. Grade 4+/5 weakness of the left deltoid, biceps, and wrist extensors was noted. Reflexes and sensory examination were normal. The neurology service was consulted. Questions for consideration: \u00b6 How would you localize the patient's symptoms? What is your differential diagnosis? Section 2 \u00b6 Chin paresthesias localize to the trigeminal nerve's mandibular segment, and potentially its distal branch, the mental nerve. The trigeminal nerve exits the pons to form its ganglion in Meckel cave, and has 3 principal branches: ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular. The mandibular branch passes through the foramen ovale and divides into anterior and posterior trunks. The anterior trunk innervates the buccal mucosa and the masticatory muscles. The posterior trunk divides into the auriculotemporal, lingual, and inferior alveolar nerves, and it is the inferior alveolar nerve that courses through the mandible and exits via the mental foramen to become the mental nerve. The paired mental nerves then supply sensation to the teeth in the lower jaw, lateral gums, lower lip, and chin (figure 1). The bilateral upper extremity paresthesias are more challenging to precisely localize; however, they are most likely in keeping with a lesion in the cervical cord or its exiting nerve roots. The patient has radicular-type pain, and with left arm weakness in the absence of upper motor neuron findings, but spanning multiple peripheral nerve territories, a cervical polyradiculopathy would be the favored localization. There could be multiple lesions involving bilateral mandibular segments of the trigeminal nerve as well as the cervical nerve roots, but a more parsimonious explanation would be a leptomeningeal process encircling the brainstem and cervical cord. Proceeding with the hypothesis of leptomeningeal disease, the differential diagnosis is broad, and would include infections such as HIV and tuberculosis, inflammatory etiologies such as sarcoidosis and Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, and neoplastic infiltration.1 There is a history of new-onset drenching night sweats, which is particularly concerning for a malignancy. Malignancies in pregnancy overall are rare, with the most common being breast, cervical, melanoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and leukemia. The presence of a numb chin is a critically important clinical clue. Patients without an identified traumatic cause or local infection should be investigated for a malignancy.3 Numb chin syndrome (NCS) has been reported over the last 50 years as a highly specific presentation for leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, mandibular or skull base metastases, or perineural tumor infiltration involving the trigeminal nerve complex.1 A systematic review of 136 cases found NCS to be the first manifestation of cancer in 27.7% and the first symptom of recurrence in 37.7%.3 Many different causative malignancies have been reported, but in that systematic review, 40.4% of patients had breast cancer, 20.5% lymphoma, 6.6% prostate cancer, and 5.1% leukemia. Question for consideration: \u00b6 How would you proceed with investigations? Section 3 \u00b6 As neoplastic infiltration of the leptomeninges is the leading diagnosis after the history and physical examination, a thorough laboratory work-up and imaging studies are needed. A complete blood count demonstrated mild anemia (11.2 g/dL), low platelets (78 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL), and elevated white blood cells (WBC) (17.9 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL). Differential showed 13,000/\u03bcL neutrophils, 600/\u03bcL metamyelocytes, and 1,300/\u03bcL myelocytes. While an elevated WBC count with predominantly neutrophils often suggests an acute infection, the presence of very immature cell types (myelocytes), as well as the anemia and thrombocytopenia, is concerning for acute leukemia. Additional systemic laboratory work-up demonstrated normal electrolytes, creatinine, creatine kinase, liver panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone, free T3 and T4, iron, and total iron binding capacity, but markedly elevated lactate dehydrogenase (1,532 U/L), ferritin (545 ng/mL), and C-reactive protein (64 mg/L). Blood and urine cultures were negative. A lumbar puncture is needed to rule out a central nervous infection and abnormal cytology would support leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, but obtaining neuroimaging of the brain and cervical spine first would be prudent. According to recent American College of Gynecology guidelines, gadolinium should be avoided in pregnancy, and MRI sensitivity will thus be reduced.4 Contrast-enhanced CT is an option in this patient, especially as she is beyond the first trimester, but it is not the ideal imaging modality for brainstem and spinal cord soft tissue pathology. An MRI of the brain and cervical spine showed no intrinsic brain or spinal cord abnormality, and the absence of gadolinium precluded a detailed examination of the leptomeninges. The vertebral bone marrow, however, was abnormal with diffuse T1 hypointensity (figure 2). In the context of the patient's clinical presentation, the finding is suggestive of neoplastic marrow infiltration. A lumbar puncture subsequently showed normal cell count, differential, glucose, and protein. Cytology demonstrated rare lymphocytes and monocytes, but no atypical cells. A single lumbar puncture for cytology has a sensitivity of less than 50%.5 The literature suggests factors that improve yield include obtaining greater than 10.5 mL of CSF, processing the specimen immediately, performing 2 or more taps, and having nearby clinical or radiologic disease. Questions for consideration: \u00b6 You have neurologic findings, no causative lesion on imaging, and a concerning but inconclusive systemic workup for a hematologic malignancy. What are your next steps? How does the patient's pregnancy change your management? Section 4 \u00b6 At this point, the case is extending beyond neurology, and it is imperative to obtain guidance from other specialties. Hematology arranged an urgent bone marrow biopsy. While a second lumbar puncture may have shown atypical cells, a bone marrow biopsy is definitive. It demonstrated acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myoblastic subtype, necessitating urgent chemotherapy. Obstetrics, concerned that they may need to deliver the baby at just 25 weeks, administered betamethasone in order to encourage fetal lung development.6 Even with modern neonatal intensive care, such a severely premature infant is likely to experience significant morbidity.6 Interestingly, the steroids improved the patient's radicular pain significantly, potentially by reducing the extent of the neoplastic leptomeningeal deposits. The hematologist and neonatologist had a detailed conversation with the patient and her husband. Starting treatment with idarubicin and cytarabine during pregnancy and incurring potential risks to the fetus from treatment was balanced against the risks of severe prematurity from immediate delivery. These include more frequent hospital admissions, greater burden of chronic disease, and overall poorer general health.7 In a systematic review of 87 pregnant patients with AML treated with systemic chemotherapy, 50% of those exposed in the first trimester had poor fetal outcomes, and some of those exposed later still experienced intrauterine fetal death, growth restriction, premature delivery, and various congenital abnormalities.8 Additional risks discussed with the patient included hemorrhage from spontaneous premature labor with treatment-induced thrombocytopenia and opportunistic infections from immunosuppression. After careful consideration, the patient elected to undergo induction chemotherapy while continuing her pregnancy. She completed it without complications, and a follow-up bone marrow biopsy showed remission of AML; however, consolidation chemotherapy was still needed. The hematologist and obstetrician discussed with the patient the risks of continuing with pregnancy during consolidation chemotherapy vs preterm delivery. At this stage, the fetus was nearing 32 weeks, transitioning from very preterm (<32 weeks) with the greatest potential for morbidity and mortality to moderate preterm (32\u201333 weeks) when outcomes are improved, but not yet equivalent to term.7 The patient delivered a healthy baby at 32 weeks by caesarean section and consolidation chemotherapy was initiated. She eventually underwent allogenic unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Her upper extremity pain, weakness, and sensory symptoms resolved, and at last follow-up, she had mild residual numbness of the left side of her chin. Discussion \u00b6 This is a complex case with a few critical take-home messages. A numb chin must always alert the clinician to thoroughly investigate for an underlying malignancy. Obtaining enhanced imaging, as long as it is permitted by the clinical situation, of the brain, skull base, and mandible is required to fully evaluate the trigeminal nerve complex.9 A detailed systemic workup looking for cancer should be tailored to the clinical history and examination. As a neurologist, it is crucial to recognize NCS and to facilitate the diagnosis of cancer, but it is just as important to involve the correct specialists in order to provide comprehensive patient care. The treatment of NCS depends on its etiology, and in those cases caused by neoplasms, the specific oncologic management is dependent on the tumor's origin, as well as the patient's clinical status. As demonstrated, pregnancy may further complicate management. Additional considerations include risks to the fetus from treatment of the malignancy and determining the safest timing of delivery, which re-emphasize the importance of consultation with other specialists. Retrospective data exist to inform treatment decisions for leukemia in pregnancy, but in the case of numb chin syndrome in pregnancy, there is a paucity of evidence in the literature. \u00b6","title":"2019-02-25 36F"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-02-25_36F/#01","text":"36yo, F, W24, G1P0 G : Gravidity (pregnant) P : Parity","title":"01"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-02-25_36F/#02","text":"","title":"02"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-02-25_36F/#03","text":"","title":"03"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-02-25_36F/#04","text":"","title":"04"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-02-25_36F/#discussion","text":"","title":"discussion"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-02-25_36F/#section_1","text":"A 36-year-old 24 weeks pregnant woman (G1P0) presented to the emergency department with a 5-day history of paresthesias involving the left side of her chin beginning at the midline and extending towards the corner of her mouth as well as intermittent bilateral upper extremity paresthesias.

Right and left wrist pain started 2 years ago and got significantly worse in the setting of intentional 25-pound weight loss over 6 months. He also had numbness in the 4th and 5th digits of his left hand for the last 3 months. Neurologic examination was notable for weakness of both thumb abduction, finger abduction, and flexion of 4th and 5th digits on the left. There was decreased sensation to pinprick in palms, as well as trace deep tendon reflexes at biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis. Questions for consideration: \u00b6 What is the localization of the patient\u2019s deficits? What is the best next diagnostic step? Section 2 \u00b6 The patient\u2019s deficits localize to bilateral median nerves (thumb abduction) and bilateral ulnar nerves (finger abduction and flexion of left 4th and 5th digits). To better localize the neuropathies\u2014for example, to determine if there is evidence of focal slowing at the carpal tunnel for the median nerves\u2014the best next diagnostic step is nerve conduction studies (NCS). These were performed and are summarized in the [table][tbl]. Question for consideration: \u00b6 What is the interpretation of these NCS? Section 3 \u00b6 NCS demonstrated that bilateral median sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) had prolonged distal latencies, with decreased amplitude on the right and normal amplitude on the left. Both median compound motor action potentials (CMAPs) had prolonged distal latencies, and bilateral ulnar CMAPs recording from the adductor digiti minimi and first dorsal interossei had focal slowing of conduction velocities across the elbows (i.e., ulnar grooves). Both sural SNAPs had prolonged peak latencies and bilateral peroneal and tibial CMAPs had slowed conduction velocities. Taken together, there was electrodiagnostic evidence for bilateral moderate median neuropathies at the wrist, i.e., carpal tunnel syndrome, and bilateral ulnar neuropathies localized to the elbows, superimposed on a generalized, demyelinating, sensorimotor polyneuropathy. A month prior to the patient\u2019s referral visit, he had an ultrasound study of bilateral median and ulnar nerves ( figure ). Question for consideration: \u00b6 What is the interpretation of these ultrasound images? Section 4 \u00b6 Ultrasound demonstrated abnormal ratios of wrist and mid-forearm cross-sectional areas (CSA) of bilateral median nerves (2.29 on right, 1.66 on left; normal <1.4) and increased CSA of bilateral ulnar nerves (13.5 mm2 on left, 21.1 mm2 on right; normal <6.5 mm2). In nerve ultrasound, increased nerve CSA corresponds with swelling, which can be seen in any focal neuropathy; for example, the median nerve at the wrist in carpal tunnel syndrome. A nerve segment is considered abnormally large when its CSA is increased in absolute terms or relative to a distant, presumably normal segment.1 In this case, increased ratio of median nerve CSA at the wrists relative to the mid-forearms and increased absolute ulnar nerve CSA at the elbows suggest neuropathies localized to these compressible sites. Questions for consideration: \u00b6 What are the differential diagnoses for this patient's presentation? What is the most likely diagnosis? What test would confirm the diagnosis? Section 5 \u00b6 The presentation of multiple focal mononeuropathies is suggestive of an underlying systemic process, as it would be highly unlikely for multiple neuropathies to occur coincidentally in an otherwise healthy individual. It is important to note that this presentation differs from that of the more common generalized polyneuropathy, for which nerve abnormalities are relatively uniform and not clearly localizable as in this case; this type of polyneuropathy can be seen in acquired disorders such as vitamin B12 deficiency or inherited disorders such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. The differential diagnosis for multiple focal neuropathies is narrow compared to generalized polyneuropathy. In the general population, these include diabetes, connective tissue disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, and vasculitic disorders such as polyarteritis nodosa causing mononeuritis multiplex. Less common diagnoses include amyloidosis and leprosy. When multiple focal neuropathies are found at common compressive sites as in bilateral carpal tunnels and ulnar grooves as in this case, one specific diagnosis to consider is hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP). This diagnosis is especially likely in a pediatric patient, in whom the aforementioned disorders associated with multiple focal neuropathies are much less likely compared to for an adult. While other systemic disorders can increase the risk of compressive neuropathy\u2014for example, carpal tunnel syndrome in amyloidosis\u2014multiple compressive neuropathies in different limbs and distributions is highly suggestive of HNPP, which is the most likely diagnosis in this case. In our patient, targeted genetic testing for HNPP demonstrated heterozygosity for deletion of all 5 exons of the peripheral myelin protein\u201322 (PMP22) gene. He was diagnosed with HNPP with symptoms that were exacerbated by weight loss. HNPP is a rare autosomal dominant peripheral neuropathy, with prevalence estimated between 0.84 and 16 per 100,000. Interestingly, a recent study in which next-generation sequencing\u2013based copy number variation analysis was performed on asymptomatic newborns found a genetic prevalence characterized by PMP22 deletion of 58.9 per 100,000, which is unsurprising given the combination of underdiagnosis and likely incomplete penetrance of the disease.2 Age at onset of first HNPP symptoms is typically in the second or third decade, with range from birth to the eighth decade. Given the rarity of the disorder, the epidemiology of HNPP in children is not well-established, although it has been suggested that clinical suspicion should be high in children with multifocal neuropathy even without a family history (in the largest case series on pediatric HNPP to date, only 25% had affected family members). HNPP is characterized by recurrent peripheral nerve injury leading to weakness or sensory loss precipitated by minor compression or trauma. The weight loss noted in this case is a well-known risk factor for compression neuropathies in general, the mechanism thought to be multifactorial, including reduction of protective subcutaneous tissue and metabolic changes.4 The molecular basis of HNPP pathophysiology is related to interactions of the PMP22 protein with proteins that regulate myelin junctions. In HNPP, neurologic examination demonstrates weakness and sensory loss in the distribution of affected nerves, with diffusely reduced deep tendon reflexes in some cases. Electrophysiologic studies demonstrate decreased motor nerve conduction velocities, prolonged distal motor latencies predominantly at sites of common nerve entrapment, and abnormal sensory nerve action potentials even in clinically unaffected nerves.6 A recent study suggests that diagnostic workup for suspected HNPP should include a complete nerve conduction study with a minimum of bilateral median, ulnar, and peroneal nerves independent of symptomology, due to typical generalization of nerve involvement.7 Sonographic evaluation may be helpful in cases in which electrodiagnostic studies and genetic testing are unavailable or not completely consistent with HNPP,8 likely unnecessary in this case as electrodiagnostic studies were highly suggestive. In terms of genetics, a contiguous gene deletion of chromosome 17p11.2 including PMP22 is found in approximately 80% of affected patients. The remainder have a pathogenic variant in PMP22, the specific mutation of which can cause a continuum of severity, ranging from a minimally symptomatic presentation to one with persistent and progressive deficits approximating a CMT presentation. The management of HNPP is generally conservative, and patients are advised to avoid external compression and minor trauma. However, recent case reports have suggested benefit with steroids (demonstrated in one patient with improvement in motor function associated with radial nerve and another associated with peroneal nerve)9 and IV immunoglobulins (demonstrated in one patient with improved lower extremity pain).10 These reports suggest that inflammation may be important in the pathophysiology of HNPP, especially in cases in which pain is a major symptom. Our patient avoided compression at the wrists by using dictation software for school to limit typing time. He also participated in occupational therapy.

In nerve ultrasound, increased nerve CSA corresponds with swelling, which can be seen in any focal neuropathy; for example, the median nerve at the wrist in carpal tunnel syndrome. A nerve segment is considered abnormally large when its CSA is increased in absolute terms or relative to a distant, presumably normal segment.1 In this case, increased ratio of median nerve CSA at the wrists relative to the mid-forearms and increased absolute ulnar nerve CSA at the elbows suggest neuropathies localized to these compressible sites.","title":"Section 4"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-03-04_15M/#questions_for_consideration_1","text":"What are the differential diagnoses for this patient's presentation?

It is important to note that this presentation differs from that of the more common generalized polyneuropathy, for which nerve abnormalities are relatively uniform and not clearly localizable as in this case; this type of polyneuropathy can be seen in acquired disorders such as vitamin B12 deficiency or inherited disorders such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. The differential diagnosis for multiple focal neuropathies is narrow compared to generalized polyneuropathy. In the general population, these include diabetes, connective tissue disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, and vasculitic disorders such as polyarteritis nodosa causing mononeuritis multiplex. Less common diagnoses include amyloidosis and leprosy. When multiple focal neuropathies are found at common compressive sites as in bilateral carpal tunnels and ulnar grooves as in this case, one specific diagnosis to consider is hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP). This diagnosis is especially likely in a pediatric patient, in whom the aforementioned disorders associated with multiple focal neuropathies are much less likely compared to for an adult. While other systemic disorders can increase the risk of compressive neuropathy\u2014for example, carpal tunnel syndrome in amyloidosis\u2014multiple compressive neuropathies in different limbs and distributions is highly suggestive of HNPP, which is the most likely diagnosis in this case. In our patient, targeted genetic testing for HNPP demonstrated heterozygosity for deletion of all 5 exons of the peripheral myelin protein\u201322 (PMP22) gene. He was diagnosed with HNPP with symptoms that were exacerbated by weight loss. HNPP is a rare autosomal dominant peripheral neuropathy, with prevalence estimated between 0.84 and 16 per 100,000. Interestingly, a recent study in which next-generation sequencing\u2013based copy number variation analysis was performed on asymptomatic newborns found a genetic prevalence characterized by PMP22 deletion of 58.9 per 100,000, which is unsurprising given the combination of underdiagnosis and likely incomplete penetrance of the disease.2 Age at onset of first HNPP symptoms is typically in the second or third decade, with range from birth to the eighth decade. Given the rarity of the disorder, the epidemiology of HNPP in children is not well-established, although it has been suggested that clinical suspicion should be high in children with multifocal neuropathy even without a family history (in the largest case series on pediatric HNPP to date, only 25% had affected family members). HNPP is characterized by recurrent peripheral nerve injury leading to weakness or sensory loss precipitated by minor compression or trauma. The weight loss noted in this case is a well-known risk factor for compression neuropathies in general, the mechanism thought to be multifactorial, including reduction of protective subcutaneous tissue and metabolic changes.4 The molecular basis of HNPP pathophysiology is related to interactions of the PMP22 protein with proteins that regulate myelin junctions. In HNPP, neurologic examination demonstrates weakness and sensory loss in the distribution of affected nerves, with diffusely reduced deep tendon reflexes in some cases. Electrophysiologic studies demonstrate decreased motor nerve conduction velocities, prolonged distal motor latencies predominantly at sites of common nerve entrapment, and abnormal sensory nerve action potentials even in clinically unaffected nerves.6 A recent study suggests that diagnostic workup for suspected HNPP should include a complete nerve conduction study with a minimum of bilateral median, ulnar, and peroneal nerves independent of symptomology, due to typical generalization of nerve involvement.7 Sonographic evaluation may be helpful in cases in which electrodiagnostic studies and genetic testing are unavailable or not completely consistent with HNPP,8 likely unnecessary in this case as electrodiagnostic studies were highly suggestive. In terms of genetics, a contiguous gene deletion of chromosome 17p11.2 including PMP22 is found in approximately 80% of affected patients. The remainder have a pathogenic variant in PMP22, the specific mutation of which can cause a continuum of severity, ranging from a minimally symptomatic presentation to one with persistent and progressive deficits approximating a CMT presentation. The management of HNPP is generally conservative, and patients are advised to avoid external compression and minor trauma. However, recent case reports have suggested benefit with steroids (demonstrated in one patient with improvement in motor function associated with radial nerve and another associated with peroneal nerve)9 and IV immunoglobulins (demonstrated in one patient with improved lower extremity pain).10 These reports suggest that inflammation may be important in the pathophysiology of HNPP, especially in cases in which pain is a major symptom. Our patient avoided compression at the wrists by using dictation software for school to limit typing time. He also participated in occupational therapy. Two months later, repeat examination demonstrated slight improvement in bilateral thumb abduction strength, and repeat NCS demonstrated slight improvement in amplitudes of bilateral median CMAPs and SNAPs. He was advised to maintain his current weight and to continue avoiding nerve compression.","title":"Section 5"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-03-04_15M/#references","text":"[Suk JI, Walker FO, Cartwright MS.

The patient had an unremarkable birth and development history. His mother also had dyspnea of unidentified cause and died suddenly at age 70 years. At age 40, a reduced vital capacity (VC) was identified in pulmonary tests during a smoking cessation treatment. He was asymptomatic. At age 45, he developed dyspnea while playing tennis without \u201csecond wind\u201d phenomenon or worsening with fasting. At that time, a creatine kinase (CK) level of 490 U/L (normal <200 U/L) was identified during treatment with statins. These were stopped but no resolution was observed. At age 46, he was hospitalized for pneumonia. Chest X-ray only revealed elevation of right diaphragm. Despite resolution of the infection, he developed orthopnea and started sleeping in the sitting position. Due to the acknowledgment of diaphragmatic weakness and the persistence of elevated CK, chest specialists referred him to the neurology department. Examination revealed unremarkable cognitive abilities, normal cranial nerves, appropriate neck strength with mild weakness (4/5) bilaterally on deltoids, iliopsoas, and quadriceps. Calf muscles were hypertrophic. The patient was unable to sit from a recumbent position without using his arms. He did not present paradoxical breathing. Muscle tone was normal. He had no atrophy, fasciculations, or scoliosis. His deep tendon reflexes were absent. Sensory and cerebellar examinations were normal. He lacked ptosis, diplopia, jaw claudication, or dysphagia. Weakness did not fluctuate throughout the day. He was on losartan 50 mg/d and clonazepam 1 mg/d. Pulmonary tests revealed a restrictive pattern with a predictive forced vital capacity of 48% with only mild deterioration during a decade of follow-up. A severe drop in the VC (>50%) was observed in the supine position, indicating diaphragmatic weakness. An oral pyridostigmine trial did not improve VC. Polysomnography revealed reduced sleep efficiency, nocturnal hypoventilation, elevated central apneas (10/h), and a saturation below 90% during 71% of total sleep time. The patient did not present sleep-related symptoms. Questions for consideration: \u00b6 What is the clinical scenario? What diagnoses should we consider? Section 2 \u00b6 The patient presented with respiratory symptoms due to diaphragmatic weakness associated with proximal muscle involvement. Early neuromuscular respiratory insufficiency represents a particular diagnostic category requiring a different approach with distinct differential diagnoses. Patients present with early respiratory involvement while still ambulatory, as opposed to most patients with neuromuscular disorders, in whom breathing difficulties are a late event. Weakness of respiratory muscles can lead to insufficient ventilation, sleep-disordered breathing, and ineffective coughing. Dyspnea, orthopnea, accessory respiratory muscle use, hypercapnia, and hypoxemia, insomnia, daytime hypersomnolence, headache, fatigue, and predisposition to aspiration and pneumonia may be observed.1 Patients will generally be referred to respiratory medicine for subtle and progressive unexplained dyspnea and can frequently be misdiagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.2 Fourteen percent of patients with myasthenia gravis and 3% of those with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may present in this manner.3 The table shows a list of neuromuscular diseases associated with early respiratory failure. Regarding our patient, the only notable laboratory result was an elevated CK of 455 U/L. Sedimentation rate was 17 mm and thyroid-stimulating hormone 1.13 \u03bcU/mL. HIV, antinuclear antibodies, anti-DNA, anti-RO/SSA, anti-LA/SSB, rheumatoid factor, acetylcholine receptor, and muscle-specific kinase antibodies were negative. Arterial blood gases and lactate were normal. EMG revealed small brief motor unit potentials with early recruitment in quadriceps, iliopsoas, and deltoid muscles without sharp waves, fibrillations, or myotonic discharges in limbs and paraspinal muscles. Routine nerve conduction studies and single-fiber EMG were normal. Cardiologic evaluation, ECG, and echocardiography were unremarkable. Questions for consideration: \u00b6 Where is the lesion located? What other studies should we perform? Section 3 \u00b6 The patient's history of progressive respiratory symptoms due to diaphragmatic weakness, proximal muscles involvement, elevated CK, myopathic EMG, and family history of unexplained dyspnea suggests a hereditary myopathy. Hence, a percutaneous biopsy of the left quadriceps was performed: specimens showed preserved muscle structure with normal histochemistry and electron microscopy. The most common hereditary myopathies presenting like the aforementioned include adult Pompe disease, myotonic dystrophy, and congenital and mitochondrial myopathies.3,4 Pompe disease, also named glycogen storage disease type II, is an autosomal recessive condition due to mutations in the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme acid \u03b1-glucosidase (GAA). Primary symptoms in one-third of the adult patients are those of respiratory insufficiency while still ambulatory. The most common symptom pattern is lower limb girdle and truncal muscular weakness combined with exercise intolerance and CK elevation. EMG usually reveals a myopathic pattern with myotonic-like discharges in limb and paraspinal muscles. Muscle pathology may reveal a vacuolar myopathy with excess glycogen storage and increased acid phosphatase staining. Early treatment with enzyme replacement may prevent progressive respiratory failure and subsequent death.5,6 Even though our patient's family history was discordant with a recessive inheritance pattern, a GAA assay using dried blood spot was done. The neutral/acid GAA activity ratio was 9.6 (normal <30) and the percentage of inhibition of acid GAA was 76% (normal <89), ruling out the disorder. Mitochondrial myopathies are due to defects in either maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA or in the autosomally inherited nuclear genome also encoding mitochondrial proteins. Manifestations confined to striated muscle may include myalgia, exercise intolerance, proximal muscle weakness, external ophthalmoplegia, or facioscapulohumeral syndrome. Patients can also present with respiratory insufficiency due to brainstem or respiratory muscle involvement. Moreover, respiratory failure may be fulminant with mild limb weakness. Lactic acid is elevated and muscle fibers have a characteristic ragged-red fiber appearance.7 Our patient presented normal lactic acid and muscle biopsy. Over the next years of follow-up, our patient developed progressive distal weakness and bilateral steppage gait. Due to his intolerance of the recumbent position, we could not perform an MRI, but a lower limbs CT scan showed bilateral fat replacement in quadriceps, iliopsoas, glutei, right anterior tibialis, extensor digitorum, and left hamstring (figure). With the aim of reaching a definite diagnosis, 3 possibilities were considered: (1) a second muscle biopsy, (2) a targeted genetic testing, and (3) a comprehensive gene panel. Question for consideration: \u00b6 How was the final diagnosis confirmed? Section 4 \u00b6 A DNA sample of the patient was sent to the Neuromuscular Research Unit of the University of Tampere in Finland. DNA was used for enrichment of a sequencing library using NimbleGen SezCap EZ choice Library protocol. The enrichment was done using the probes of MYOcap v3 gene panel targeting the exons of 265 genes known or predicted to cause muscular dystrophy or myopathy. A heterozygous mutation c.95351C > T p.A31784V in exon 344 of the TTN gene was identified. Mutations in this particular exon in this gene cause a titinopathy known as hereditary myopathy with early respiratory failure (HMERF). Titin is the largest known polypeptide in nature and acts aiding in the myofibrillar assembly during myogenesis, determining the relaxed sarcomere length and regulating transcription.8 Mutations in the TTN gene may cause a range of skeletal muscle diseases and multiple cardiomyopathies. HMERF is an autosomal dominant slowly progressive myopathy that begins in the adult life presenting with gait disturbances related to distal or proximal limb weakness and progressive respiratory insufficiency. This disease, originally identified in Scandinavian populations, is now known to be distributed worldwide. Prevalence is unknown but it is probably underrecognized. Respiratory muscle weakness develops early in the disease course and can be the presenting symptom, usually including nocturnal hypoventilation, orthopnea, dyspnea on exertion, and daytime somnolence. Muscle weakness affects predominantly the lower limbs and frequently ankle dorsiflexion. Calf hypertrophy is frequent but calf atrophy can occur in a more advanced disease stage. CK is generally mildly elevated and MRI shows fatty replacement on affected muscles with the typical but not specific pattern of obturatorius, semitendinosus, and anterior and posterior tibial muscles. Findings in muscle biopsy may include multiple eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions in a necklace fashion, blue-rimmed vacuoles, myofibrillar abnormalities with Z-disc streaming, and electron-dense cytoplasmic bodies.9 Changes can be focal, with groups of several fibers showing marked alterations, whereas other regions might be less affected or even normal. Due to sampling and the focal nature of pathologic changes, muscle biopsy may sometimes be nonspecific. This can explain why our patient had normal muscle pathology despite findings on EMG and CT in the quadriceps muscle. Differential diagnoses include adult Pompe disease, myofibrillar myopathies, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, mitochondrial myopathies, myasthenia gravis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.2,10 There is no disease-modifying treatment; therapy includes the use of orthoses and mobility aids, physiotherapy, and respiratory support. Our case highlights the importance of considering early neuromuscular respiratory insufficiency as a distinctive syndrome leading to a challenging and broad differential diagnosis. Identifying the underlying condition has implications regarding specific and symptomatic treatment. A combination of muscle biopsy and genetic studies is still the best approach to hereditary myopathies. The former allows the structural characterization of the myopathy guiding the search for the most likely mutations. On the other hand, the identification of different mutations, especially those of unclear significance, requires correlation with structural abnormalities to confirm their pathogenicity.

HIV, antinuclear antibodies, anti-DNA, anti-RO/SSA, anti-LA/SSB, rheumatoid factor, acetylcholine receptor, and muscle-specific kinase antibodies were negative. Arterial blood gases and lactate were normal. EMG revealed small brief motor unit potentials with early recruitment in quadriceps, iliopsoas, and deltoid muscles without sharp waves, fibrillations, or myotonic discharges in limbs and paraspinal muscles. Routine nerve conduction studies and single-fiber EMG were normal. Cardiologic evaluation, ECG, and echocardiography were unremarkable.","title":"Section 2"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-03-04_54M/#questions_for_consideration_1","text":"Where is the lesion located?

Hence, a percutaneous biopsy of the left quadriceps was performed: specimens showed preserved muscle structure with normal histochemistry and electron microscopy. The most common hereditary myopathies presenting like the aforementioned include adult Pompe disease, myotonic dystrophy, and congenital and mitochondrial myopathies.3,4 Pompe disease, also named glycogen storage disease type II, is an autosomal recessive condition due to mutations in the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme acid \u03b1-glucosidase (GAA). Primary symptoms in one-third of the adult patients are those of respiratory insufficiency while still ambulatory. The most common symptom pattern is lower limb girdle and truncal muscular weakness combined with exercise intolerance and CK elevation. EMG usually reveals a myopathic pattern with myotonic-like discharges in limb and paraspinal muscles. Muscle pathology may reveal a vacuolar myopathy with excess glycogen storage and increased acid phosphatase staining. Early treatment with enzyme replacement may prevent progressive respiratory failure and subsequent death.5,6 Even though our patient's family history was discordant with a recessive inheritance pattern, a GAA assay using dried blood spot was done. The neutral/acid GAA activity ratio was 9.6 (normal <30) and the percentage of inhibition of acid GAA was 76% (normal <89), ruling out the disorder. Mitochondrial myopathies are due to defects in either maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA or in the autosomally inherited nuclear genome also encoding mitochondrial proteins. Manifestations confined to striated muscle may include myalgia, exercise intolerance, proximal muscle weakness, external ophthalmoplegia, or facioscapulohumeral syndrome. Patients can also present with respiratory insufficiency due to brainstem or respiratory muscle involvement. Moreover, respiratory failure may be fulminant with mild limb weakness. Lactic acid is elevated and muscle fibers have a characteristic ragged-red fiber appearance.7 Our patient presented normal lactic acid and muscle biopsy. Over the next years of follow-up, our patient developed progressive distal weakness and bilateral steppage gait. Due to his intolerance of the recumbent position, we could not perform an MRI, but a lower limbs CT scan showed bilateral fat replacement in quadriceps, iliopsoas, glutei, right anterior tibialis, extensor digitorum, and left hamstring (figure). With the aim of reaching a definite diagnosis, 3 possibilities were considered: (1) a second muscle biopsy, (2) a targeted genetic testing, and (3) a comprehensive gene panel.","title":"Section 3"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-03-04_54M/#question_for_consideration","text":"How was the final diagnosis confirmed?","title":"Question for consideration:"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-03-04_54M/#section_4","text":"A DNA sample of the patient was sent to the Neuromuscular Research Unit of the University of Tampere in Finland. DNA was used for enrichment of a sequencing library using NimbleGen SezCap EZ choice Library protocol. The enrichment was done using the probes of MYOcap v3 gene panel targeting the exons of 265 genes known or predicted to cause muscular dystrophy or myopathy. A heterozygous mutation c.95351C > T p.A31784V in exon 344 of the TTN gene was identified. Mutations in this particular exon in this gene cause a titinopathy known as hereditary myopathy with early respiratory failure (HMERF). Titin is the largest known polypeptide in nature and acts aiding in the myofibrillar assembly during myogenesis, determining the relaxed sarcomere length and regulating transcription.8 Mutations in the TTN gene may cause a range of skeletal muscle diseases and multiple cardiomyopathies. HMERF is an autosomal dominant slowly progressive myopathy that begins in the adult life presenting with gait disturbances related to distal or proximal limb weakness and progressive respiratory insufficiency. This disease, originally identified in Scandinavian populations, is now known to be distributed worldwide. Prevalence is unknown but it is probably underrecognized. Respiratory muscle weakness develops early in the disease course and can be the presenting symptom, usually including nocturnal hypoventilation, orthopnea, dyspnea on exertion, and daytime somnolence. Muscle weakness affects predominantly the lower limbs and frequently ankle dorsiflexion. Calf hypertrophy is frequent but calf atrophy can occur in a more advanced disease stage. CK is generally mildly elevated and MRI shows fatty replacement on affected muscles with the typical but not specific pattern of obturatorius, semitendinosus, and anterior and posterior tibial muscles. Findings in muscle biopsy may include multiple eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions in a necklace fashion, blue-rimmed vacuoles, myofibrillar abnormalities with Z-disc streaming, and electron-dense cytoplasmic bodies.9 Changes can be focal, with groups of several fibers showing marked alterations, whereas other regions might be less affected or even normal. Due to sampling and the focal nature of pathologic changes, muscle biopsy may sometimes be nonspecific. This can explain why our patient had normal muscle pathology despite findings on EMG and CT in the quadriceps muscle. Differential diagnoses include adult Pompe disease, myofibrillar myopathies, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, mitochondrial myopathies, myasthenia gravis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.2,10 There is no disease-modifying treatment; therapy includes the use of orthoses and mobility aids, physiotherapy, and respiratory support. Our case highlights the importance of considering early neuromuscular respiratory insufficiency as a distinctive syndrome leading to a challenging and broad differential diagnosis. Identifying the underlying condition has implications regarding specific and symptomatic treatment. A combination of muscle biopsy and genetic studies is still the best approach to hereditary myopathies. The former allows the structural characterization of the myopathy guiding the search for the most likely mutations. On the other hand, the identification of different mutations, especially those of unclear significance, requires correlation with structural abnormalities to confirm their pathogenicity.","title":"Section 4"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-03-04_54M/#references","text":"[Boentert M, Wenninger S, Sansone VA.

Six months prior, he started noticing weakness in the hand. This progressively worsened and led to difficulty in manipulating objects. The patient denied sensory symptoms. The patient\u2019s family history was unremarkable. His medical history included hypertension and a peripheral facial nerve palsy at age 15. At 57 years of age, he had undergone total thyroidectomy for a mixed papillary and follicular carcinoma. Neurologic examination revealed weakness of the abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscle and interosseous muscles (Medical Research Council [MRC] grade 3/5) and flexor muscles of the third, fourth, and fifth fingers (MRC 4/5) of the left hand, in the absence of atrophy. Tendon reflexes were normal except for slightly increased left cubito-pronator; the Hoffmann reflex was absent; plantar responses were flexor. The rest of the examination was normal. The patient had had blood tests performed elsewhere including hematocrit, kidney and liver function, vitamin B12, folic acid, homocysteine, Hb1Ac, inflammatory markers, creatine phosphokinase, thyroid hormones, and autoimmune and onconeural screening, which had normal results. Questions for consideration: \u00b6 What is the localization? What is the differential diagnosis? Section 2 \u00b6 The clinical signs could suggest a C8-T1 radiculopathy limited to the motor roots, due to the absence of sensitive symptoms. A medial cord injury could be considered due to the involvement of ADM, interosseous muscles, and flexor ulnaris carpi, although abductor brevis pollicis was normal and no sensory signs were detected. Another diagnostic hypothesis is an ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, although considered less likely due to the clinical involvement of the flexor muscle of the third finger (innervated by the median nerve) and the absence of sensory symptoms, usually expected in an ulnar entrapment. Moreover, an ulnar neuropathy at the wrist could be clinically excluded, due to the weakness of the flexor muscles (which are not affected in this condition). Finally, the increased left cubito-pronator reflex is not consistent with a peripheral nerve disorder, suggesting the possibility of an upper motor neuron disorder. The patient underwent cervical spine MRI and ultrasound of the ulnar nerve at the elbow, which were unremarkable. Moreover, the patient had also previously undergone MRI of the left wrist elsewhere, which turned out normal. In order to explore a possible peripheral disorder, a nerve conduction study (NCS) should be performed. The sensory and motor conduction studies of the median nerve bilaterally showed normal findings as well as the motor conduction studies of the ulnar nerve recording from ADM. Conversely, the study of the ulnar nerve recording from the first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI) bilaterally disclosed a partial conduction block (CB) in the forearm (figure 1). Questions for consideration: \u00b6 How would you interpret the electrodiagnostic findings? Are neurophysiologic studies sufficient to make a diagnosis? Section 3 \u00b6 Focal CB is identified by showing a compound muscle action potential (CMAP) drop across the site of block: the CMAP after stimulation proximal to the site of block is smaller than the CMAP after stimulation distal to the site of block, with approximately the same duration. When the CB does not occur across a compression site (the wrist or the elbow), it could suggest the presence of an acquired demyelinating peripheral neuropathy, such as motor neuropathy with conduction block, also called multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). This entity is a rare neuropathy usually presenting with asymmetrical weakness of distal upper limbs, fitting a specific nerve territory. According to the European Federation of Neurologic Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society guideline,1 our patient could be diagnosed with possible MMN, due to the clinical involvement of 1 nerve and the presence of motor conduction block in 2 nerves on electrophysiologic testing. Therefore, this diagnostic hypothesis was considered. However, the electrodiagnostic findings did not justify the clinical signs and symptoms, since the CBs were bilateral despite unilateral clinical disturbances and neurologic signs (weakness of left hand, normal strength in right hand). Question for consideration: \u00b6 Is there another explanation for these electrophysiologic findings? Section 4 \u00b6 Another explanation of these electrophysiologic findings is a Martin-Gruber anastomosis (MGA), a known neuroanatomic variant. Indeed, a short segment study of bilateral ulnar motor nerve recording from FDI confirmed a drop in amplitude between the wrist and below-elbow sites; the stimulation of the median nerve (at the same level of the drop in the ulnar CMAP amplitude) recording from FDI evoked a CMAP approximately equal to the drop in amplitude in ulnar studies (figure 2A). These findings were bilaterally consistent with the presence of a crossover from median nerve or its branches to the motor fibers of ulnar nerve going to the first interosseous muscle, known as MGA. The ultrasound of the median and ulnar nerves in the forearm confirmed the presence of the anastomosis: a nervous branch arose from the median nerve just below the pronator teres muscle and crossed over to join the ulnar nerve in the middle third of the forearm. MGA is the most common nerve anatomic variant found in the upper extremities and is seen in around 11%\u201339% of normal individuals.2 It involves only motor fibers, sparing the sensory fibers. The 3 most common sites of MGA origin are the branches of the median nerve supplying the superficial forearm flexor muscles, the anterior interosseous nerve, or the main median nerve. In electrophysiologic studies, the type of MGA is classified into 3 groups according to the muscles innervated by the crossover fibers: in type I, the hypothenar muscles (mainly, ADM); in type II, the FDI; and in type III, the thenar muscles. Type II is the most common form, even if not often recognized during routine electrodiagnostic studies, the ADM being the muscle most often recorded for ulnar motor studies. In our patient, the discovery of this anatomical variant should be considered only a normal finding, which did not explain the clinical presentation of hand weakness. Question for consideration: \u00b6 How would you continue the diagnostic work-up? Section 5 \u00b6 At this point, a cerebral CT to exclude central lesions was performed. CT showed a lytic lesion of the parietal bone on the right side characterized by an intact but remolded outer table and an interrupted inner table with a large defect. Thus the patient underwent a cerebral 3T MRI that confirmed the presence of a right parasagittal defect of the inner table of the parietal bone containing CSF and a mass of herniated brain tissue including rolandic gyrus, which was hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images, as gliosis (figure 2, B\u2013D). A diagnosis of symptomatic meningoencephalocele of the right rolandic region was finally achieved. After a few months, the patient underwent neurosurgical treatment consisting of craniotomy, dural opening, and reduction of the herniated brain tissue, followed by duraplasty and replacement of the outer table of the skull. At the 2-month follow-up, the weakness of the hand was improved. Discussion \u00b6 This case highlights the importance of the clinical context when interpreting electrodiagnostic studies. Our patient presented with left hand weakness, carrying a symptomatic meningoencephalocele of the right rolandic region and a bilateral MGA, which could mislead the diagnosis. The intradiploic meningoencephalocele is an extremely rare condition caused by a defect of the inner table of the calvarium and subsequent herniation of the meninges and cerebral parenchyma into the intradiploic space.3 Since 1976, very few cases of intradiploic encephaloceles have been reported in the literature. Most of them occurred within the parietal bone and were related to a trauma or neurosurgery; one case within the frontal bone was caused by an accidental tear of the dura during a craniosynostosis repair.4,\u2013,8 More recently, a spontaneous frontal intradiploic meningoencephalocele has been reported in a 60-year-old woman with a history of multiple traumatic head injuries during her childhood. The authors hypothesized that \u201cspontaneous\u201d meningoencephaloceles may be caused by a traumatic event not recalled or believed not relevant by the patient, even in the distant past. When we asked the patient about any head injury, he reported a head trauma a few months before the onset of his symptoms. The diagnostic delay in this case could be due to the presence of a drop in the ulnar CMAP amplitude in the forearm, mimicking an ulnar conduction block consistent with an acquired demyelinating peripheral neuropathy. Moreover, the clinical symptoms of the patient could be confusing, mimicking an ulnar nerve territory, even if unilateral instead of bilateral neurophysiologic abnormal findings. Therefore, a deep clinical reasoning allowed us to consider the diagnosis of MMN unlikely, and led us to perform another focused NCS, achieving the diagnosis of MGA. MGA is an under-recognized entity in routine electrodiagnostic studies, since it could mimic an ulnar neuropathy or a peripheral neuropathy with CB. Neurophysiologists and clinicians should be aware of screening for the presence of MGA in case of apparent CB across the forearm, especially when discrepancy between neurophysiologic and clinical findings exists. \u00b6","title":"2019-03-18 58M"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-03-18_58M/#01","text":"","title":"01"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-03-18_58M/#02","text":"","title":"02"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-03-18_58M/#03","text":"","title":"03"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-03-18_58M/#04","text":"","title":"04"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-03-18_58M/#05","text":"","title":"05"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-03-18_58M/#discussion","text":"","title":"discussion"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-03-18_58M/#section_1","text":"A 58-year-old man presented to our neurologic clinic with progressive distal weakness in the left hand.

A brain MRI including magnetic resonance angiography and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) at a local hospital was normal. A lumbar puncture revealed a CSF pressure of 240 mm H2O. An intracranial infection was suspected based on clinical symptoms and signs. He received empiric antiviral therapy and rehydration for 1 week, but there was no relief of symptoms. He was subsequently transferred to our hospital. On admission, the patient endorsed poor spirits and poor dietary intake. He denied any neurologic deficits and his vital signs were normal. The neurologic examination revealed meningeal signs and symmetric hyperactive deep tendon reflexes of both lower extremities. Questions for consideration: \u00b6 What is the differential diagnosis for progressive headache? What tests could help narrow the differential diagnosis for this patient? Section 2 \u00b6 Headache is a common symptom in the general population. This includes primary headache disorders such as migraine or tension-type headaches or secondary headache disorders that may be due to infection, sinusitis, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), or neoplastic disease. When headaches develop acutely without any history of prior headache, a secondary headache disorder should be considered. If there is clinical evidence of infection, considerations include sinusitis, pharyngitis, or meningitis. Otherwise, a space-occupying lesion or vascular process can be considered. Considering the differential diagnosis above, the diagnostic battery for this patient includes an MRI with contrast to evaluate for mass lesions and meningeal enhancement, MRV to rule out CVST, serum studies, and a lumbar puncture to evaluate for opportunistic infections. Serum studies revealed a normal white blood cell count (10.07 \u00d7 109/L), neutrophils (7.26 \u00d7 109/L), and homocysteine (63.5 \u03bcmol/L). The coagulation profile was slightly abnormal with prolonged prothrombin time (14.8 seconds), elevated D-dimer (4.38 \u03bcg/mL), and normal activated partial thromboplastin time (31.1 seconds). Other routine tests including urinalysis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein showed no abnormalities. Lumbar puncture revealed a CSF pressure of 170 mm H2O. The cell count was normal and the CSF protein level was 513 mg/L (normal range 150\u2013450 g/L). CSF cultures and cytology revealed no obvious abnormalities. Head CT, brain MRI (figure 1), and MRV scans (figure 2A) showed multiple CVSTs. Despite the relatively high sensitivity of MRV in confirming CVST, there is a small false-negative rate,2 and therefore repeat MRV testing is recommended. Question for consideration: \u00b6 What can cause multiple CVSTs in a formerly healthy adolescent with a negative family history of clotting disorders? Section 3 \u00b6 CVST accounts for about 0.5%\u20131% of all strokes. The etiology generally includes comorbid medical conditions, pregnancy, dehydration, infection, medications (e.g., oral contraceptives, substance abuse), and unpredictable events (e.g., head trauma). We screened for risk factors associated with CVST. Rheumatic and immunologic examination, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and hormone concentrations were nearly normal. A screen for thrombotic disease revealed no antithrombin deficiency, protein C (PC) deficiency, or factor V Leiden mutation. The plasma protein S (PS) anticoagulant activity was 22%, profoundly lower than the normal range. PS deficiency (PSD) is a disorder of blood clotting and is present in 0.1%\u20130.3% of the general population and 1%\u20133% of people with incident venous thromboembolism.4 People with hereditary PSD have a 2- to 11-fold increased risk for developing a deep venous thrombosis of the lower limbs with or without pulmonary embolism.5 Hereditary PSD is caused by mutations in the PROS1 gene, which codes for PS. A written consent form, stating acceptance of the genetic testing, was signed by the patient and his parents. Thrombophilia-associated genes including but not limited to ABCD4, CBS, MTHFR, MTR, MTRR, and MMADHC were assayed. A novel PROS1 frameshift mutation (PROS1, c.1751_1752delTG [p.Leu584ArgfsX7; Het]) that generates a premature stop codon was identified in the patient and his mother but not in his father (figure 3). Based on the single nucleotide polymorphism database, this suspected pathogenic mutation was extremely rare in the normal population. His parents underwent serum coagulation testing, which revealed that his mother also had a severe reduction in PS activity (table). [ ][tbl.01] Question for consideration: \u00b6 What treatment would you recommend for this patient? Section 4 \u00b6 The acute management of CVST involves controlling elevated intracranial pressure and treating the thrombosis. Guidelines recommend anticoagulation with a therapeutic dose of heparin as the primary treatment for CVST. For patients with CVST who are medically stable, treatment with a vitamin K antagonist should be initiated.3 The patient received mannitol and glycerol fructose to reduce intracranial pressure. His headache improved after 1 week of treatment. At the same time, he was given low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) 4.25 kU twice daily for 2 weeks, followed by dabigatran etexilate, a direct thrombin inhibitor metabolized through the cytochrome P450 system, at 110 mg twice daily. The patient was discharged after clinical improvement. His cerebral MRV showed return of normal venous blood flow 6 months after his discharge (figure 2, B\u2013D). Discussion \u00b6 We report a teenager who presented with persistent headache due to multiple CVSTs due to familial PSD with a novel PROS1 frameshift mutation. Although CVST is characterized by a variety of symptoms, including headache, seizure, lethargy, focal neurologic signs, convulsions, and coma, headache is the most frequent symptom and occurs in 75%\u201395% of all cases. Cerebral infection can be differentiated from CVST by CSF testing and the treatment is different for the 2 diseases. In addition, elevated serum D-dimer can be an important indicator of CVST.3 This case highlights that CVST cannot be excluded in a patient with persistent headache, even if there is no personal or family history of thrombosis and even after a single normal MRV scan. Thrombophilia can be hereditary or acquired. Hereditary thrombophilia is caused by genetic defects that result in abnormal functional protein levels such as antithrombin deficiency, PS deficiency, PC deficiency, factor V Leiden mutation, or factor II G20210A mutation. Acquired thrombophilia can be due to antiphospholipid syndrome, malignant tumors, or a prothrombotic state (surgery, trauma, prolonged immobilization). Hyperhomocysteinemia is also a risk factor for arterial and venous thrombosis that can lead to CVST.7 This patient presented with high levels of homocysteine (>20 mmol/L) and PSD. After genetic testing of the patient and his family, a diagnosis of familial PSD was made. Hereditary PSD is a haploinsufficiency disorder associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis. Individuals with this condition do not have enough functional PS to inactivate clotting proteins, which results in the increased risk of developing abnormal blood clots. Rarely, PSD is acquired in patients with liver disease, warfarin use, vitamin K deficiency, pregnancy, and other conditions. PS is encoded by the PROS1 gene located on chromosome 3 at 3q11.2. The genetic basis of PSD is heterogeneous. More than 200 mutations in PROS1 have been described, mainly missense or nonsense mutations. Null mutations result in severe PS defects by reducing PS synthesis. Missense mutations can have severe, intermediate, or mild consequences.6 Zhang et al.8 reported a novel PROS1 mutation causing PSD in a family after a proband was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism. CVST is rarely seen in association with PSD. Amaral et al.9 reported a case of CVST in a young adult with familial PSD but the patient and his family members did not receive PROS1 genetic testing. We detected a PROS1 frameshift mutation in a patient with CVST that, to our knowledge, has not been reported in the literature. The mutation in the affected family members (patient and mother) was consistent with their reduced PS level, indicating that this mutation was the molecular basis of the PSD and CVST. Guidelines recommend heparin as the primary treatment for CVST. The optimal duration of anticoagulant treatment is currently being evaluated, generally between 3 and 12 months, or longer in rare cases.3 Although heparin and warfarin have been used historically, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban have been reported to be alternatives.10 Our patient received dabigatran etexilate, after LMWH, and recovered both clinically and radiographically without bleeding events. From our experience, for patients presenting with persistent headache, one should consider CVST, even if there is no history of thrombotic events. D-dimers and CSF testing are important to differentiate CVST from cerebral infection in the early stage. Once hereditary PSD is considered, genetic testing is recommended for both the patient and family members. Furthermore, while the newer DOACs have been applied in CVST, further robust studies are needed to validate the therapeutic effect of DOACs in inherited thrombophilia. \u00b6","title":"2019-03-25 15M"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-03-25_15M/#01","text":"","title":"01"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-03-25_15M/#02","text":"","title":"02"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-03-25_15M/#03","text":"","title":"03"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-03-25_15M/#04","text":"","title":"04"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-03-25_15M/#discussion","text":"","title":"discussion"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-03-25_15M/#section_1","text":"A previously healthy 15-year-old boy with no relevant medical history presented with 3 weeks of severe, persistent, holocephalic pain associated with nausea and vomiting, without fever or alteration of consciousness.

This includes primary headache disorders such as migraine or tension-type headaches or secondary headache disorders that may be due to infection, sinusitis, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), or neoplastic disease. When headaches develop acutely without any history of prior headache, a secondary headache disorder should be considered. If there is clinical evidence of infection, considerations include sinusitis, pharyngitis, or meningitis. Otherwise, a space-occupying lesion or vascular process can be considered. Considering the differential diagnosis above, the diagnostic battery for this patient includes an MRI with contrast to evaluate for mass lesions and meningeal enhancement, MRV to rule out CVST, serum studies, and a lumbar puncture to evaluate for opportunistic infections. Serum studies revealed a normal white blood cell count (10.07 \u00d7 109/L), neutrophils (7.26 \u00d7 109/L), and homocysteine (63.5 \u03bcmol/L). The coagulation profile was slightly abnormal with prolonged prothrombin time (14.8 seconds), elevated D-dimer (4.38 \u03bcg/mL), and normal activated partial thromboplastin time (31.1 seconds). Other routine tests including urinalysis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein showed no abnormalities. Lumbar puncture revealed a CSF pressure of 170 mm H2O. The cell count was normal and the CSF protein level was 513 mg/L (normal range 150\u2013450 g/L). CSF cultures and cytology revealed no obvious abnormalities. Head CT, brain MRI (figure 1), and MRV scans (figure 2A) showed multiple CVSTs. Despite the relatively high sensitivity of MRV in confirming CVST, there is a small false-negative rate,2 and therefore repeat MRV testing is recommended.","title":"Section 2"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-03-25_15M/#question_for_consideration","text":"What can cause multiple CVSTs in a formerly healthy adolescent with a negative family history of clotting disorders?","title":"Question for consideration:"},{"location":"Neurol/CR/2019-03-25_15M/#section_3","text":"CVST accounts for about 0.5%\u20131% of all strokes.
