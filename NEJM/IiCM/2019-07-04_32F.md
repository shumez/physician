> A 32-year-old woman presented to the outpatient clinic with a 2-month history of anal pruritus and bleeding. She reported occasional constipation but no abdominal pain. On physical examination, her abdomen was nontender, and rectal examination revealed hemorrhoids. Laboratory results showed a hemoglobin level of 11.2 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0) and a white-cell count of 8600 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 4000 to 10,000) with 0.9% eosinophils (reference range, 1 to 5). The patient underwent colonoscopy, which revealed a 1-cm worm moving in the anus (Panel A and [video][vid]). The nematode was identified as a female *Enterobius vermicularis* — also known as pinworm — that was carrying eggs measuring 50 to 60 μm by 20 to 30 μm that were elongated and flattened on one side ([Panel B][fig]). The patient’s 5-year-old daughter also reported anal pruritus and had classmates in whom pinworm infection had recently been diagnosed. The patient and her family members were treated with oral [albendazole], and at follow-up 2 months later the anal pruritus in the patient and her daughter had disappeared.
