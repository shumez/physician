## Original

[![Fig][fig]][fig]

An 18-year-old man presented to the emergency department with generalized tonic–clonic seizures. His parents reported that he had been having pain in the right [groin](. "鼠径部") for 1 week. On physical examination, the patient was confused. He had swelling over the right eye and tenderness in the right testis. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed numerous well-defined cystic lesions throughout the cerebral cortex (Panel A) and the brain stem and cerebellum (Panel B) that were consistent with [neurocysticercosis](. "神経嚢虫症"). Well-defined cysts that contained [echogenic](. "エコーを発生する") nodules were seen on ultrasonography of the eye and the right testis. Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed positive results for serum cysticercosis IgG antibody. In the context of high cyst burden, **treatment with antiparasitic medications can worsen inflammation and cerebral edema, and in the presence of ocular lesions, inflammation can lead to loss of vision**. Therefore, antiparasitic medications were not administered in this case. Despite treatment with dexamethasone and antiepileptic medications, the patient died 2 weeks later.
