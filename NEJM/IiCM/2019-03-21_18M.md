## Original

An 18-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of sore throat, fever, and [malaise](. "倦怠感") and a 3-day history of pleuritic chest pain and productive cough. He reported no history of intravenous drug use, recent travel, or known sick contacts. On examination, he was febrile and ill-appearing and had an oxygen saturation of 88% while breathing ambient air. A chest radiograph showed consolidation in the middle and upper portions of the left lung, and computed tomography of the chest revealed multiple cavitary lesions (Panel A) and a loculated left pleural effusion. An anaerobic blood culture obtained at the time of admission grew Fusobacterium necrophorum (Panel B). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the neck revealed an intraluminal filling defect in the right internal jugular vein, a finding suggestive of thrombus (Panel C, arrow). **Lemierre’s syndrome** was diagnosed. Lemierre’s syndrome is characterized by [thrombophlebitis](. "血栓性静脈炎") of the internal jugular vein and evidence of disseminated infection (often septic pulmonary emboli), typically after a recent oropharyngeal infection. The patient underwent drainage of the pleural effusion and received intravenous ceftriaxone and oral metronidazole. At follow-up after the completion of antimicrobial therapy, he had recovered well.
