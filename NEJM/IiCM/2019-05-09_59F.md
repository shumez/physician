> A 59-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 4-day history of inflammation and pain in the right eye. She had been blind in the eye for several years before presentation. The physical examination showed [proptosis](. "眼球突出") of the right eye, with periorbital inflammation, ophthalmoplegia, and a right relative afferent pupillary defect. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a right orbital mass measuring 2.8 cm by 2.5 cm by 2.3 cm with intraocular and extraocular components ([Panel A](#fig)). The patient’s levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were normal, but there were elevations in the alkaline phosphatase level (245 U per liter; reference range, 31 to 95) and the γ-glutamyltransferase level (225 U per liter; reference range, 7 to 37). Abdominal and thoracic imaging showed numerous hepatic masses, abdominal and thoracic lymphadenopathy, and vertebral sclerotic osseous disease, findings that were consistent with widely metastatic disease. The right eye was [enucleate](. "摘出する, 眼球除去する")d for palliative relief and to obtain tissue for diagnosis ([Panel B](#fig)). Immunohistochemical evaluation supported the diagnosis of **uveal melanoma**. The patient was treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab, but she died from progressive disease 2 months after presentation.
