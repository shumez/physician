> A 51-year-old woman with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease presented to the primary care clinic with mild worsening of chronic abdominal pain. No jaundice was found on physical examination; the liver was enlarged, and the patient had mild tenderness in the right upper [quadrant] and in the [flank]s on both sides. Murphy’s sign was absent. Laboratory studies showed mildly elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. [Innumerable] cysts were found on abdominal ultrasonography; the gallbladder could not be visualized. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography was performed and revealed a markedly enlarged liver with numerous cystic structures (a three-dimensional maximum-intensity-projection reconstruction is shown in the figure). No signs of intracystic hemorrhage, rupture, or infection were found; the presentation was not consistent with acute cholecystitis. In autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, cysts can develop in a range of sites, including the liver, pancreas, and seminal vesicles. The patient was treated with intravenous hydration and analgesia, and the pain decreased. At a 1-year follow-up visit, no additional complications or new symptoms had developed. The patient continued to have occasional abdominal pain.
