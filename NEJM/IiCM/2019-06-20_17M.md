## Original

[![Figure][fig]][fig]

> A 17-year-old boy presented to the emergency department with pain and swelling in his jaw 2 hours after an e-cigarette exploded during use. The patient was in a hemodynamically stable condition and had no respiratory distress. He had a circular puncture to the chin, extensive [laceration]s in his mouth, multiple disrupted lower [incisor]s, and bony [incongruity] of the left mandible. Reconstructed computed tomography of the head revealed a [comminute]d and displaced mandibular fracture with disruption of the left central and lateral incisors ([Panel A][fig]). The patient underwent open reduction and [internal fixation] of the fracture, dental extraction, and débridement of [devitalize]d tissue. The increasing prevalence of vaping among adolescents is a public health concern. At the 6-week follow-up assessment, the patient had recovered well, and the mandibular–maxillary fixation was removed ([Panel B][fig]).
