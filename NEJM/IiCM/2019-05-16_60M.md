> A 60-year-old man presented to the otorhinolaryngology clinic with a feeling of nasal obstruction and postnasal drip that had developed 10 years earlier and had worsened over the past month. He also had a sensation of a foreign body in his throat. Symptoms worsened when he was lying flat. On physical examination, no deviation of the nasal septum or hypertrophy of the inferior [turbinate]s was detected. Nasopharyngoscopy revealed a smooth, pink, cystic mass in the midline of his nasopharynx, with no obstruction of the openings to the [eustachian tube]s (the image shows the view through the right naris). Computed tomography of the head revealed a 2.5 cm by 1.3 cm by 1.4 cm cystic tumor in the midline of the nasopharynx without intracranial extension. The findings were consistent with Tornwaldt’s cyst, a benign cyst that arises between the roof of the nasopharynx and the remnant of the [notochord]. Because the patient was symptomatic, he underwent surgical [marsupialization] of the cyst. On follow-up examination 3 months after surgery, he no longer had the sensation of a foreign body in his throat, his nasal symptoms were reduced, and there was no recurrence of the cyst.
